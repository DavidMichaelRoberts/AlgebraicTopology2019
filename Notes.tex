\lecturenum{1} \section{What is it?}

Algebraic topology is the study of maps 
\[
	\{\text{Spaces}\} \longrightarrow \{\text{Algebraic objects}\},
\] 
%
or rather, `well-behaved' such maps. They should also send continuous functions between spaces to 
algebraic maps, respecting composition (so: \emph{functors}); they should send spaces built 
out of simpler spaces to algebraic objects built out of simpler components, in a compatible way, 
etc.

Here, `Spaces' roughly means topological spaces up to deformation (usually homotopy, but not 
always). Such equivalence classes are called \emph{homotopy types}. `Algebraic objects' means  
(abelian) groups, rings, modules, or even chain complexes of these \marginnote{a chain complex is a certain sequence of maps $\cdots \to V_0 \to V_1 \to V_2 \to 
\cdots$}.

\begin{example} 
	How can we tell if the sphere $S^2$ and the torus $S^1\times S^1$ can or 
	cannot be deformed into each other? How would you prove it cannot be done? 
\end{example}

\begin{example} 
	For a positive example, we \emph{can} squash $\RR^3 \setminus \{0\} \to S^2 \into 
	\RR^3 \setminus \{0\} $, sending $x\mapsto \frac{x}{|x|}$. This map continuously 
	deforms to the identity map. So dimension not necessarily preserved.
\end{example}

\begin{example} 
	Can we have $S^1 \sim S^2$? 
\end{example} 

\noindent We first need to understand how spaces are built

\section{Topological spaces}

Recall\ldots\marginnote{From Topology and Analysis III}

\begin{definition} 
	A \emph{topology} on a set $X$ is a collection $\cT$ of subsets of $X$ 
	such that 
	\begin{enumerate} 
	
		\item $\emptyset,X\in\cT$ 
		
		\item If $U,V\in \cT$ then $U\cap V\in \cT$ 

		\item If $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ is an arbitrary family of sets in $\cT$, then $\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} U_\alpha \in \cT$\marginnote{$I$ here is an indexing set}

	\end{enumerate}
 
	If $U\in \cT$ we say $U$ is \emph{open}. A \emph{topological space} is a set $X$ 
	eqipped with a topology $\cT$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} 
	Take the set of real numbers, the \emph{Euclidean (`usual') topology} is 
	defined by saying a set is open iff it is a union of open intervals $(a,b)$ (including the 
	union of no sets ie $\emptyset$).\\ 
	The \emph{discrete topology} on a set $X$ is defined by 
	taking every $\cT$ to consist of all subsets. The \emph{indiscrete topology} is defined by 
	taking $\cT$ to consist of just $\emptyset$ and $X$. 
\end{example}

This definition is concise, but not always the best way to define a topology. We will also 
use \emph{neighbourhoods}

\begin{definition} 
	A set $N\subseteq X$ is a \emph{neighbourhood}\marginnote{`nhd' is a good 
	abbreviation} (in a given topology $\cT$) of a point $x\in X$ if there is an open 
	set $U\subseteq N$ with $x\in U$.
\end{definition}


\begin{example} 
	Take $\RR$ with the Euclidean topology. $(-1,1)$, $[-1,1]$, $[-1,1)$ are all 
	neighbourhoods of every $-1<x<1$, but $[0,1)$ is not a neighbourhood of $0$. More 
	complicated: $[0,1] \cup \{2\}\cup [5,6]$ is a nhd of all $0<x<1$ and $5<x<6$.
\end{example}

\begin{example} 	
	Consider a metric space $(X,d)$. The \emph{metric topology} is defined by saying a 
	subset $U\subseteq X$ is open iff for every $x\in U$ there is some $\varepsilon_x > 
	0$ with the open ball $B(x,\varepsilon_x) \subseteq U$. Open balls around $x$ are 
	neighbouhoods of $x$, as are closed balls.
\end{example}

Here is a more concrete approach that allows concise definitions of topologies:

\begin{definition} 
	A \emph{neighbourhood base} $\cN$ on a set $X$ is a family 
	$\{\cN(x)\}_{x\in X}$ where each $\cN(x)$ is a nonempty collection of subsets of $X$, 
	satisfying the following, for all $x\in X$: 

	\begin{enumerate} 

	\item For all $N\in \cN(x)$, $x\in N$;
 
	\item For all $N_1,N_2 \in \cN(x)$, there is some $N\in \cN(x)$ with $N\subseteq N_1 
	\cap N_2$;

	\item For all $N\in \cN(x)$ there is a subset $U\subseteq N$ such that for 
	all $y\in U$, there is some $V \in \cN(y)$ such that $V\subseteq U$. 

	\end{enumerate} 

	We say the sets in $\cN(x)$ are \emph{basic neighbourhoods} of $x$. 
\end{definition}

As an example: given a topological space $(X,\cT)$ defining $\cN(x)$ to consist of all nhds 
of $x$ gives a nhd base. Similarly, defining $\cN'(x)$ to consist of all open sets 
containing $x$ defines a nhd base.


Given a neighbourhood base $\cN$ on a set $X$, define a subset $U\subseteq X$ to be 
\emph{$\cN$-open} iff for all $x\in U$, there is an $N\in \cN(x)$ with $N\subseteq U$.

\begin{prop} 
The $\cN$-open sets define a topology on $X$. 
\end{prop} 

\begin{proof} 
We verify the axioms for a topology on $X$. 

\begin{enumerate}

\item The condition that $\emptyset$ is $\cN$-open is vacuously true. And since $\cN(x)$ is 
not empty, there is a basic nhd around every point, so $X$ is $\cN$-open.

\item Given $U,V$ both $\cN$-open, we want to show $U\cap V$ is $\cN$-open. So take $x\in 
U\cap V$. We know there is $N_U,N_V \in \cN(x)$ with $N_U \subseteq U$ and $N_V \subseteq 
V$, and also that $x\in N_U \cap N_V$, since it is in each of them. Thus there is some $N\in 
\cN(x)$ with $N \subseteq N_U \cap N_V \subseteq U\cap V$, and this is true for all $x\in 
U\cap V$. Hence $U\cap V$ is $\cN$-open.

\item Given a family $U_\alpha$, $\alpha\in I$, with each $U_\alpha$ $\cN$-open, we want to 
show $U := \bigcup_{\alpha\in I}U_\alpha$ is $\cN$-open. Take $x\in U$, so there is some 
$\alpha_0$ with $x\in U_{\alpha_0}$. But this set in $\cN$-open, so there is some nhd $N$ of 
$x$ with $N\subseteq U_{\alpha_0} \subseteq U$, and this is true for all $x\in U$. So $U$ is 
$\cN$-open. \qedhere

\end{enumerate} 
\end{proof}

We call the topology from this proposition the topology generated by $\cN$. Neighbourhoods 
in this topology are sets that contain a basic neighbourhood: $V$ is a neighbourhood of $x$ 
if there is some $N\in \cN(x)$ with $N\subseteq V$.

Given a neighbourhood base $\cN$ on $X$, we can identify the \emph{closure} of a set 
$S \subset X$ as the collection of points $x\in X$ such that for all $N\in \cN(x)$, 
$\exists s\in N\cap S$.


\begin{example} 
Given a metric space $(X,d)$ the open balls form a nhd base on $X$ and the 
topology they generate is the metric topology. 
\end{example}



Hence many definitions you are familiar with from metric spaces work for topological spaces, if 
they can be phrased in terms of basic nhds. In particular, continuity!

\begin{definition} 
Let $\cN_X$ and $\cN_Y$ be neighbourhood bases on sets $X$ and $Y$ 
respectively. A function $f\colon X\to Y$ is \emph{continuous} if for every $x\in X$ and 
$N\in \cN_Y(f(x))$, the set $f^{-1}(N)$ contains a basic nhd of $x$. 
\end{definition}

This is a big generalisation of the $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ definition of continuity.

\begin{ex} 
Show\marginnote{Recall a function is continuous for topologies if 
$f^{-1}(U)$ is open for all open $U$.} that if $f\colon (X,\cN_X)\to (Y,\cN_Y)$ is 
continuous as just defined, it is continuous for the topologies generated on $X$ and $Y$ by 
these nhd bases. 
\end{ex}

As a sanity check,\marginnote{You can check every function \emph{to} an indiscrete space 
is continuous, as is every function \emph{on} a discrete space} the identity function 
$\id_X$ on a space $X$ is indeed continuous.

\begin{definition}
A continuous function $f\colon X\to Y$ is a \emph{homeomorphism} if there is a continuous 
function $g\colon Y\to X$ with $g\circ f = \id_X$ and $g\circ f = \id_Y$. 
We then call $X$ and $Y$ \emph{homeomorphic}\marginnote{or just isomorphic, if I'm being lazy}
 if there is a homeomorphism between them.
\end{definition}


Now we need to show how to build new spaces, and continuous maps relating them to the 
original spaces.

\begin{definition} 
Let $X$ be a set, $(Y_\alpha,\cN_\alpha)$, $\alpha \in I$ a family of 
sets with nhd bases (not necessarily all unique), and $f_\alpha\colon X\to Y_\alpha$ a 
family of functions. The \emph{initial topology} on $X$ is generated by the following nhd 
base: a subset of $X$ is a basic nhd of $x$ iff\marginnote{Exercise: verify this is a nhd base!} 
 it is of the form $f_{\alpha_1}^{-1}(N_1) \cap \ldots \cap f_{\alpha_k}^{-1}(N_k)$ for 
some $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_k$ and $N_i \in \cN_{\alpha_i}(f_{\alpha_i}(x))$. 
\end{definition}

This generalises the product topology, which is the case that $X = Y_1 \times Y_2$, and 
$f_i\colon X\to Y_i$ is the projection $f_i(y_1,y_2) = y_i$, where $i=1,2$. But this 
\emph{also} gives the subspace topology: take $f\colon X\into Y$ to be injective and define 
the initial topology on $X$.

\begin{lemma} 
Giving $X$ the initial topology, all the functions $f_\alpha\colon X\to 
Y_\alpha$ are continuous. Moreover, a function $k\colon Z\to X$ is continuous iff 
$f_\alpha\circ k\colon Z\to Y_\alpha$ is continuous for every $\alpha$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}\lecturenum{2}
If the set of functions consists of a single \emph{injective} map, namely $\iota\colon X\into Y$, with
$Y$ a space, then the initial topology is the subspace topology: basic nhds of $x$ correspond 
to sets $\iota^{-1}(N)$ (basically $N\cap X$) for $N$ a basic nhd of $\iota(x)$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If however we have a constant function $c_{y_0}\colon X\to Y$, sending $x\mapsto y_0 \in Y$ for all $x$, then
for every nhd $N$ of $y_0$, $c_{y_0}^{-1}(N) = X$. So the only nhd of every $x\in X$ is $X$ itself.
Thus the initial topology is indiscrete in this case. 
\end{example}

In general, given the family of functions $f_\alpha\colon X\to Y_\alpha$, there is a function
$(f_\alpha)\colon X\to \prod_\alpha Y_\alpha$. If we give $\prod_\alpha Y_\alpha$ the product 
topology, then the initial topology on $X$ from the family of maps is the same as the initial
topology from the map $(f_\alpha)$ to the product space. So if this latter map is injective,
$X$ inherits the subspace topology from the product topology. This is the major use-case we
will come across for the initial topology.

\begin{example}
A submanifold $M\subseteq \RR^n$ gets its topology from the coordinate functions 
$M\into \RR^n \xrightarrow{x_i} \RR$, and a map to $M$ is continuous iff the composite with
the maps to each factor of $\RR^n$ are continuous.
\end{example}


\begin{ex}
Given a set $X$, a space $Y$ and a function $f\colon X\to Y$, if two points $x_1,x_2$ 
satisfy $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$, show that a subset $V\subseteq X$ is a nhd of $x_1$ iff it is a nhd
of $x_2$, in the initial topology.
\end{ex}

The following will be even more important for us, and will be new to most.

\begin{definition} 
Let $X$ be a set, $(Z_\beta,\cN_\beta)$, $\beta \in J$ a family of topological spaces 
(not necessarily all unique), and $g_\beta\colon Z_\beta\to X$ a family of 
functions (note the other direction!). The \emph{final topology}\marginnote{this really is 
easier to describe using open sets, rather than nhds} on $X$ has open sets as 
following: $U\subset X$ is open iff for all $\beta\in J$, $g_\beta^{-1}(U)$ is open in 
$Z_\beta$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma} 
Giving $X$ the final topology, all the functions $g_\beta\colon Z_\beta\to X$ 
are continuous. Moreover a function $h\colon X\to W$ is continuous for the final topology on 
$X$ iff $h\circ g_\beta\colon Z_\beta\to W$ is continous for every $\beta\in J$. 
\end{lemma}

We will give two special cases of this, and we will see them often.

\begin{example} 
Let $Z$ be a topological space, and let $\sim$ be an equivalence 
relation on $Z$, and define $X = Z/\!\sim$ to be the quotient by this relation. There is a 
function $ \pi\colon Z\to X$ sending $y\mapsto [y]$. The final topology on $X$ has as open 
sets those $U\subseteq X$ such that $\pi^{-1}(U)$ is open in $Z$. 
\end{example}

For instance, we can give $S^2$ the initial topology for the maps $x,y\colon S^2 \to \RR^2 
\to \RR$ (this is the usual topology on $S^2$), and then define an equivalence relation on 
$S^2$ by $x\sim y$ iff $x = - y$. The quotient is $\mathbb{RP}^2$, the real projective 
plane, and we give it the final topology coming from $S^2\to \mathbb{RP}^2$. This is the 
topology it carries as a manifold. Incidentally, $S^2$ is an example of a \emph{covering 
space} of $\mathbb{RP}^2$, the study of which will occupy the first section of the course.


Recall the definition of disjoint union of sets: given $Z_\beta$, 
 $\beta\in J$, a family of sets, we have $\mathrm{in}_\gamma \colon Z_\gamma \into 
 \bigsqcup_{\beta} Z_\beta$ with $Z_\beta \cap Z_\gamma = \emptyset$ for $\beta\neq \gamma$. 
 If $Z_\beta$ are spaces, then we give $\bigsqcup_{\beta} Z_\beta$ the final topology for 
 the maps $\mathrm{in}_\gamma$. This is \emph{disjoint union} or \emph{sum} 
topology,\marginnote{an important fact is that the map 
$\bigsqcup_\beta X\times Z_\beta \to X\times \bigsqcup_\beta Z_\beta$ 
is a homeomorphism (exercise!)} and $\bigsqcup_{\beta} Z_\beta$ is sometimes called the 
\emph{topological sum}. A point in $\bigsqcup_{\beta} Z_\beta$ can be described by a pair 
$(\beta,z)$, where $z \in Z_\beta$.

\begin{ex} 
Given continuous functions $h_\beta\colon Z_\beta \to W$, there is a unique continuous function $h = 
\langle h_\beta \rangle \colon \bigsqcup_\beta Z_\beta\to W$ with $h_\beta = h\circ 
\mathrm{in}_\beta$, or in other words this diagram commutes: 
\[
	\xymatrix{ 
		Z_\gamma \ar[r]^{\mathrm{in}_\gamma} \ar[dr]_{h_\gamma} & \bigsqcup_\beta 
		Z_\beta \ar[d]^h \\ & W
	}
\] 
\end{ex}

\begin{lemma} 
The final topology on $X$ for $g_\beta\colon Z_\beta \to X$ agrees with the 
final topology on $X$ for $g = \langle g_\beta \rangle\colon \bigsqcup_\beta Z_\beta \to X$, 
using the sum topology. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} 
We have that $U\subseteq X$ is open iff $\forall \beta$ $g_\beta^{-1}(U)$ is 
open iff $\forall \beta$, $(g\circ \mathrm{in}_\beta)^{-1}(U) = 
\mathrm{in}_\beta^{-1}\left(g^{-1}(U)\right)$ is open iff $g^{-1}(U)$ is open in the sum 
topology. 
\end{proof}

The idea behind the final topology, when $g_\beta\colon Z_\beta \to X$ are jointly 
surjective,\marginnote{%
this means $\forall x\in X$, $\exists \beta, x\in Z_\beta$ with 
$g_\beta(z) = x$} 
is that we can put an equivalence relation on $\bigsqcup_\beta Z_\beta$ 
with $(\beta_1,z_1)\sim (\beta_2,z_2)$ iff $g_{\beta_1}(z_1) = g_{\beta_2}(z_2)\in X$. As a 
set, $X$ is the set of equivalence classes under this relation, so you can think of it as 
gluing together the \emph{underlying sets} of the spaces $Z_\beta$. The final topology on $X$ is 
then the only sensible topology to described the space we get by gluing together the 
\emph{spaces} $Z_\beta$. 

\begin{ex}
Given an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of a space $X$, then $X$ carries the final topology for 
the inclusion maps $U_\alpha \into X$, or equivalently for the map 
$\bigsqcup_\alpha U_\alpha\to X$.
\end{ex}

\begin{example}
An arbitrary manifold $M$ has the final topology arising from any choice of atlas.
\end{example}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:closed_cover_gluing_lemma}
Given a \emph{finite} closed cover $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of $X$, then $X$ carries the final 
topology for $\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n V_i \to X$.
\end{ex}

\begin{example}\label{example:interval_final_topology}
Any closed interval $[a,b]\subset \RR$ with the subspace topology has the final topology 
arising from a collection of subintervals $[a,t_1]$, $[t_1,t_2]$,\ldots,$[t_k,b]$, each
with the subspace topology from $\RR$.
\end{example}

These exercises give us what is sometimes known as the \emph{gluing lemma}:

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:gluing_lemma}
Consider a space $X$ and an arbitrary open cover $\{U_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ 
(respectively a finite closed cover $\{V_i\}_{i=1}^n$) and suppose $Y$ is some other 
topological space. Then if a function $f\colon X\to Y$ is continuous when restricted to each 
$U_\alpha$ (resp.\ to each $V_i$) then $f$ is continuous.
\end{lemma}

Later we'll see spaces that are built up by gluing together lots 
of `simple' spaces, like disks $D^n := \{x\in \RR^n\mod |x|\leq 1\}$ (with the subspace 
topology from $\RR^n$). But what does `simple' here mean? Roughly, ``shrinkable to a 
point''.

\section{Homotopy}

``Shrinkable'' implies a kind of continuous process in time. Consider the function $I\times D^n \to D^n$. Consider the map
\begin{align*}
	H\colon I \times D^n & \to D^n\\
	(t,\mathbf{x}) & \mapsto (1-t)\mathbf{x}
\end{align*}
Note that this gives maps $H_0\colon D^n\to D^n$ (the identity map) and $H_1$ (constant at $0$).
The function $H$ is continuous! 
How should we see this? 
The topology on $D^n$ is the subspace topology $D^n \subset \RR^n$,\marginnote{And $I\subset \RR$ has subspace topology}  and $\RR^n$ has the product topology. 
so the topology on $D^n$ is also the final topology for the coordinate functions 
$x_i\colon D^n \to \RR^n \to \RR$. 
So $H\colon I\times D^n \to D^n$ is continuous iff
\[
	\xymatrix@R=0.5pc{
	I\times D^n \ar[r]^{\id\times x_i} & I\times \RR \ar[r]& \RR\times\RR \ar[r]& \RR\\
	(t,\mathbf{x}) \ar@{|->}[rr] && (t,x_i) \ar@{|->}[r] & tx_i 
	}
\]
But $I\times D^n \to \RR \times \RR$ is continuous by definition of final topology, and the following result:

\begin{ex}
	If $f\colon X\to W$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ are continuous, then so is $f\times g\colon X\times Y\to W\times Z$. 
	If both $X$ and $Y$ have at least one point each, then the reverse implication also holds.
\end{ex}

So if we can prove that multiplication $\RR\times \RR \to \RR$ is continuous, then $H$ is continuous.
But the standard topology on $\RR$ comes from the metric space structure, so can use sequential criterion for continuity.
Take $(a_n,b_n)\to (a,b)$ in $\RR\times \RR$, then:
\begin{align*}
	|a_nb_n - ab| 	& = |a_nb_n -ab_n + ab_n - ab| \\
			& \leq |a_n - a|\,|b_n| + |a|\,|b_n - b| \\
			& \leq |a_n-a| \sup|b_n| + |a| \, |b_n - b|\qquad\text{(as $(b_n)$ converges, it is bounded)} \\
			& \to 0+0  
\end{align*}
Hence $H$ is continuous.

\begin{definition}
	A space $X$ is \emph{contractible}\marginnote{or, \emph{contractible to $x_0\in X$}} if there is a point $x_0\in X$ and a continuous function $H\colon I\times X\to X$ such that $H(0,x) = x$ and $H(1,x) = x_0$ for all $x\in X$. 
Such a function is called a \emph{contraction}.
\end{definition}

We have shown $D^n$ is contractible.

\begin{ex}
$\RR$ is contractible. An arbitrary product of contractible spaces is contractible.
\end{ex}

\begin{example}
Consider what it would mean if a discrete space $S$ were contractible: there would be an element $*\in S$ and a continuous function $h\colon I\times S \to S$ such that $h(0,s) = s$ and $h(1,s) = *$. 
Restricting $h$ to $I\times \{s\}$ for some given $s$, we get a continuous function $I \into I\times S \to S$, whose range includes $*$ and $s$.
Since all functions with discrete domain are continuous, let us compose with the continuous function $\chi_{\{*\}}\colon S\to \RR$ that sends $*\mapsto 1$ and $s\mapsto 0$ for all $s\neq *$. 
So we have a continuous function $\widetilde{h}\colon I\to \RR$ with $\widetilde{h}(0)=0$ and range contained in $\{0,1\}$.
By the intermediate value theorem, we must have $\widetilde{h}(1) = \chi_{\{*\}}(h(1,s))= 0$, so that $h(1,s) = *$, and hence $s=*$ for all $s\in S$. 
Thus $S$ has exactly one element.
\end{example}

\begin{q}
If $X$ is contractible, does the choice of point $x_0\in X$ matter? Is $X$ also contractible
to $x\in X$ for $x\neq x_0$?
\end{q}

The interval can only map continuously to a discrete space if it is constant at some 
element, or equivalently, its image consists of a single point, and this property is 
important enough to have a name.

\begin{definition}\label{def:connected}
A space $X$ is \emph{connected}\marginnote{If you know the `usual' definition, this is 
equivalent to it} if every continuous map to a discrete space has image a single point.
\end{definition}

So the interval $I$ is an example of a connected space. Even better: if a pair of points $x,y\in X$ 
have a \emph{path} between them (a map $I\xrightarrow{\gamma} X$ with $\gamma(0) = x$, $\gamma(1)=y$)
then any function $f\colon X\to S$ to a discrete space has $f(x)=f(y)$.

\begin{example}
Every contractible space is connected. This is because in a contractible space $X$, for every point $y$ 
there is the path $t\mapsto H(t,y)$ joining $y$ to the point $x_0$, so that $f(y)=f(x_0)$ for every map 
$X\xrightarrow{f}S$ to discrete $S$.
\end{example}

There are however lots of spaces that are connected but not contractible, but we cannot 
yet prove this.



This\lecturenum{3} is our first example of an invariant of spaces,\marginnote{%
Consider $\xymatrix@=1pc{X\ar[r]^\simeq \ar[d] & Z \ar[dl]\\ S}$ with $S$ discrete.
}
namely whether they are connected or not: a connected space $X$ cannot be homeomorphic 
to a space $Z$ that is not connected. But, how can we tell non-connected spaces apart?

\begin{definition}
\begin{enumerate}

	\item For any space $X$, a subset $Y\subseteq X$ is a \emph{connected component} 
	of $X$ if $Y$ is connected and for any connected $Y'\subseteq X$ such that $Y\subseteq Y'$,
	then $Y= Y'$.
	
	\item Put an equivalence relation on $X$ generated\marginnote{%
		Exercise: If $C,D\subseteq X$ are connected, and $\exists x \in C\cap D$, then
		$C\cup D$ is connected. Also show: the equivalence classes are the 
		connected components.}
		by $x_1\sim x_2$ iff $x_1$ and $x_2$ 
		are both contained in a connected subset $C\subseteq X$. Then define 
		$\pi_0(X) = X/\sim$, the \emph{set of connected components}. 

\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Every connected space $X$ has $\pi_0(X) = *$, but now we can tell apart non-connected 
spaces, by comparing their $\pi_0$.\marginnote{Such spaces are called `locally 
connected', but we will eventually be 
assuming a slightly stronger condition. Be warned: $\mathbb{Q}$ with the Euclidean 
topology is \textbf{not} locally connected, nor are many very interesting examples!} 
Every space that we will be consider in this 
course can be written as $X = \bigsqcup_{\alpha\in\pi_0(X)} X_\alpha$, with $X_\alpha$ 
connected, and have a continuous function $X\to \pi_0(X)$ where $\pi_0(X)$ has the discrete
topology. 
As a result, we need to try to understand \emph{connected} spaces, though we 
will still \emph{use} non-connected spaces.

Can we get more out of the idea of contractions? Given $H\colon I\times X\to X$, we have 
maps $H_i$ for $i=0,1$, namely $H_0 = \id_X$ and $H_1$ is constant at $x_0$. What if 
$H_0$ and $H_1$ were other sorts of continuous maps? \medskip

\begin{example}\label{eg:annulus}
Consider the annulus $A(r,R) := \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2\mid r\leq |x| \leq R\}$, and the function 
$H(t,x) = ((1-t)r + tR)x/|x|$.
\end{example}

What if we considered general continuous maps $X\to Y$ instead of just $X\to X$?

\begin{definition}
	A \emph{homotopy} is a continuous function $H\colon I \times X\to Y$. 
	If $f = H(0,-)$ and $g = H(1,-)$, we say $H$ is a \emph{homotopy from $f$ to $g$}, and that $f$ and $g$ are \emph{homotopic}, written $f\sim g$.
\end{definition}

Example \ref{eg:annulus} gives a homotopy between the two `retraction' maps $A(r,R) \to 
A(r,R)$, mapping points to the inner and outer circles respectively.

Algebraic topology most of the time considers functions \emph{up to homotopy}, and also 
``spaces up to homotopy''.

\begin{definition}
A continuous function $f\colon X\to Y$ is called a \emph{homotopy equivalence} if there is a continuous function $g\colon Y\to X$ such that $g\circ f\sim \id_X$ and $f\circ g\sim \id_Y$. We then say $X$ and $Y$ are \emph{homotopy equivalent}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
A contractible space is homotopy equivalent to a one-point space.
\end{example}

You should think of homotopy equivalences as being `kinda like isomorphism', but coarser.
Going back to our original motivation, the maps
\[
	\{\text{Spaces}\} \longrightarrow \{\text{Algebraic objects}\}
\]
under consideration should take homotopy equivalent spaces to isomorphic algebraic objects. 
To make this more rigorous we will use the language of category theory.


%
Here is a super-important property of homotopies we will use continuously.

\begin{prop}
Given homotopies $H\colon I \times X \to Y$ and $H'\colon I \times X \to Y$ such that $H_1 = H'_0\colon X\to Y$, there is a homotopy $H''$ from $H_0$ to $H_1$, and a homotopy $\widetilde{H}$ from $H_1$ to $H_0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We will use Exercise~\ref{ex:closed_cover_gluing_lemma} applied to the closed cover $\{[0,\frac12]\times X, [\frac12,1]\times X\}$ of $I\times X$. 
Since $I \simeq [0,\frac12]$ and $I\simeq [\frac12,1]$, $H$ and $H'$ give us maps $[0,\frac12]\times X \simeq I\times X\xrightarrow{H} Y$ and $[0,\frac12]\times X \simeq I\times X\xrightarrow{H'} Y$ respectively. By the assumption on $H_1$ and $H'_0$, we get a well-defined function $H''\colon I\times X\to Y$, which is then continuous by the Exercise. It is a simple check to see it is a homotopy from $H_0$ to $H'_1$. \\
For the second part, let $c\colon I\to I$ be the function $c(t) = 1-t$. Then define $H''$ to be the composite $I\times X \xrightarrow{c\times \id_X} I \times X \xrightarrow{H}Y$, which has the required properties.
\end{proof}

Contractible spaces supply many homotopies.

\begin{lemma}
Every continuous function $f\colon X\to Y$, with $Y$ a contractible space (say to $y_0\in Y$), is homotopic to a function with range contained in $\{y_0\}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $H\colon I\times Y \to Y$ be a homotopy witnessing the contractility of $Y$. Then the composite $I\times X \xrightarrow{\id_I \times f} I\times Y \xrightarrow{H} Y$ is a homotopy from $f$ to the the desired function.
\end{proof}

As a corollary, every pair of functions to a contractible space are homotopic.
Since contractible spaces are in some sense trivial, maps to them are in the same sense trivial.

An important intermediate version of this is when we consider only the case where $X$ is discrete, or is even just $\pt$:

\begin{definition}
A space $Y$ is \emph{path-connected}\marginnote{This condition is equivalent to requiring 
it for \emph{all} discrete spaces in place of $\pt$ (Exercise!)} if every map $\pt \to Y$ is homotopic 
to every other such map.
\end{definition}

Unpacking this, we see this means that for any two points $\pt \to Y$ there is a path 
$I\to Y$ connecting them, i.e.\ $H\colon I \simeq I \times \pt \to Y$.

\begin{prop}
A path-connected space is connected
\end{prop}


Let us define $[X,Y] = \{\text{continuous }f\colon X\to Y\}/\text{homotopy}$. 
The set of \emph{path components} of $Y$ is then the set $[\pt,Y]$. 
% If equipped with the final topology arising from the surjective function $Y\to [\pt,Y]$, we 
% denote the resulting topological space by $[\pt,Y]^{top}$.
The space $Y$ is called \emph{path connected} if $[\pt,Y]=*$.

We have been discussing topological spaces and continuous maps, but also implicitly sets 
and functions, not necessarily continuous, and passing between these two pictures. In 
both cases we have composition that is associative, and identity maps. Later we shall be 
using different classes of topological spaces in order to ensure the behaviour we 
require will hold.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{category} $\cC$ consists of a collection of \emph{objects} $W,X,Y,Z,\ldots$ and for each pair of objects $X,Y$ a collection of \emph{morphisms}, denoted $\cC(X,Y)$, together with the following data:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	
	\item For each pair $f\in \cC(X,Y)$ and $g\in \cC(Y,Z)$, a specified morphism $g\circ f\in \cC(X,Z)$,

	\item For every object a specified morphism $\id_X\in\cC(X,X)$,

\end{enumerate}
\noindent
such that:
\begin{enumerate}

	\item For every triple $h\in \cC(W,X)$, $f\in \cC(X,Y)$ and $g\in \cC(Y,Z)$ we have $g\circ(f\circ h) = (g\circ f)\circ h$,

	\item For every object $X$ and $h\in \cC(W,X)$, $f\in \cC(X,Y)$ we have $\id_X\circ h = h$ and $f\circ \id_X = f$.

\end{enumerate}
For $f\in \cC(X,Y)$ we say $X$ is the \emph{source} of $f$, $Y$ is the \emph{target} of 
$f$, and write $X=s(f)$, $Y=t(f)$. We also write $f\colon X\to Y$ or $X\xrightarrow{f} 
Y$ to indicate that $f\in \cC(X,Y)$. If $\cC(X,Y)$ is a set\marginnote{Most categories 
you will encounter are locally small} for all $X,Y$, then $\cC$ is called \emph{locally 
small}, and each $\cC(X,Y)$ is called a \emph{hom-set}.
\end{definition}


Many examples of categories have objects sets carrying extra structure (for instance a 
topology) and morphisms that are functions compatible with that structure---but not all 
categories. We have seen $\Top$, the category of topological spaces (and continuous 
maps) and $\Set$, the category of sets (and functions), and you implicitly already 
know\marginnote{Vector spaces, (abelian) groups, manifolds, rings, \ldots}
 many other examples.

\begin{example}
The category $\Set_*$ of pointed sets $(X,x)$ ($x\in X$ a specified element) and pointed maps 
$(X,x) \to (Y,y)$ (functions $f\colon X\to Y$ with $f(x) = y)$) can be considered as consisting
of algebraic objects of the weakest sort (compare homomorphisms, linear transformations, ring 
maps, etc, which preserve distinguised elements).
\end{example}


The whole point of categories is how they relate to each other, an isolated category can 
only tell us so much.

\begin{definition}
Given categories $\cC$ and $\cD$, a \emph{functor} from $\cC$ to $\cD$, denoted $F\colon \cC\to \cD$ consists of the data:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]

	\item For every object $X$ of $\cD$, a specified object $F(X)$ of $\cD$,

	\item For every morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ of $\cC$, a specified morphism $F(f)\colon F(X) \to F(Y)$ of $\cD$

\end{enumerate}
\noindent
such that for every pair $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ of morphisms of $\cC$, $F(g\circ f) = F(g)\circ F(f)$. This latter property is called `functoriality'. For locally small categories, the assignment on morphisms gives a function $\cC(X,Y) \to \cD(F(X),F(Y))$.\marginnote{We will use this notation even without making that assumption}
\end{definition}

We have already see at least four examples of functors:
\begin{itemize}

	\item The underlying set functor $U\colon \Top \to \Set$
	\item The discrete topology functor $\mathrm{disc}\colon \Set \to \Top$\marginnote{the indiscrete topology also gives rise to a functor $\Set \to \Top$, but we won't be using it}
	\item The set of connected components functor $\pi_0\colon \Top \to \Set$

\end{itemize}

\noindent
although we haven't yet seen why $\pi_0$ is a functor. We can compose functors in the 
obvious way, so get functors $\mathrm{disc}U\colon\Top\to \Top$ and 
$\mathrm{disc}\pi_0\colon\Top\to\Top$, for instance.

Here is a trivial-seeming example (aside from the identity functor).

Let $\cC$ be a category, and $\cD$ a \emph{subcategory}: a collection of some of the 
objects of $\cC$ and some of the morphisms of $\cC$ that form a category by themselves. 
Then the inclusion of the objects and the morphisms forms a functor $\cD\into \cC$, the 
\emph{subcategory inclusion}. An important special case of this is when for every $X$ 
and $Y$ that are objects of $\cD$, every $\cD(X,Y) = \cC(X,Y)$; then $\cD$ is call a 
\emph{full} subcategory. More generally we can consider a functor that is injective on 
objects and morphisms to define a subcategory.

\begin{example}
The\marginnote{we have used and will use this result without comment} functor 
$\mathrm{disc}\colon \Set \to \Top$ makes $\Set$ a full subcategory of $\Top$.
\end{example}

We will be later restricting attention to certain full subcategories of $\Top$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:image_of_connected}
Let $X$ be a connected space, and let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a continuous function. 
Then $\im(f) \subset Y$ is connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be a discrete space and let $g\colon \im(f)\to S$ be a continuous function.
Then the composite $X\to \im(f) \to S$ has image $\{s\}\subseteq S$, hence $\im(g)=\{s\}$
and so $\im(f)$ is connected.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
The assignment $X\mapsto \pi_0(X)$ is a functor $\Top \to \Set$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We need to show there is an assignment 
$(f\colon X\to Y)\mapsto (\pi_0(f)\colon \pi_0(X) \to \pi_0(Y))$, 
for an arbitrary continuous function $f$. 
Fix $f\colon X\to Y$ and let $\alpha\in \pi_0(X)$. Then this corresponds to a connected
component $X_\alpha \subseteq X$, and we know $f\big|_{X_\alpha}$ has connected image.
Thus this image is contained inside a single connected component of $Y$, and we define
$\pi_0(f)(\alpha)$ to be the corresponding element of $\pi_0(Y)$.

Given another map $g\colon Y\to Z$, and the corresponding function 
$\pi_0(g)\colon \pi_0(Y)\to\pi_0(Z)$, one can check that $\pi_0(g)\pi_0(f)(\alpha)$, for 
$\alpha\in \pi_0(X)$ is the same as $\pi_0(g\circ f)(\alpha)$, and $\pi_0(\id)$ is also
the identity map. This proves that $\pi_0$ is a functor $\Top \to \Set$.
\end{proof}

Here is a bonus second proof for locally connected spaces.
\begin{proof} 
We already know we have a map $X\to Y \to \pi_0(Y)$, continuous since $X$ and $Y$ are 
locally connected, and we want to show this 
\emph{descends} along $X\to \pi_0(X)$. Given any $\alpha \in \pi_0(X)$, it corresponds to a 
connected component $X_\alpha$ of $X$. Look at the restriction of $X\to Y\to\pi_0(Y)$ to 
$X_\alpha$: since $X_\alpha$ is connected, its image is exactly one point in $\pi_0(Y)$. 
So define $\pi_0(f)(\alpha)=[f(x)]$ for an arbitrary $x\in X_\alpha$.
This defines $\pi_0(f)$. Moreover, the following diagram \emph{commutes}:
\[
	\xymatrix{
		X\ar[r]^f \ar[d] & Y \ar[d]\\
		\pi_0(X) \ar[r]_{\pi_0(f)} & \pi_0(Y) 
	}
\]

Now we want to show that $\pi_0(g\circ f) = \pi_0(g)\circ \pi_0(f)$. Given $\alpha \in \pi_0(X)$, and $x\in X_\alpha$, then $\pi_0(f)(\alpha) = [f(x)]$. 
To define $\pi_0(g)\left(\pi_0(f)(\alpha)\right)$, we need to choose a point in the component $Y_{[f(x)]}$, so take it to be $f(x)$.
Then $\pi_0(g)\left(\pi_0(f)(\alpha)\right) = [g(f(x))]$, but this is just  $\pi_0(g\circ f)(\alpha)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}
Show that $[\pt,-]\colon \Top \to \Set$ is a functor.\marginnote{Or more generally, 
$[X,-]\colon \Top\to \Set$!}
\end{ex}

Another important example of a category is the \emph{homotopy category} $\Ho$. 
\marginnote{Exercise: prove this is a category} The objects are topological spaces, but 
$\Ho(X,Y) = [X,Y]$. There is a functor $\Top \to \Ho$, which is the identity on objects, 
and sends a map to its homotopy class. Objects are isomorphic in $\Ho$ iff they are 
homotopy equivalent.

\begin{prop}
The functor $\pi_0$ descends to a functor $\Ho \to \Set$
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We will prove that this is well-defined on morphism on hom-sets, the rest is routine. 
For $f,g\colon X\to Y$ to be homotopic via $H\colon I\times X\to Y$, we need to show that for all $\alpha \in \pi_0(X)$, $\pi_0(f)(\alpha) = \pi_0(g)(\alpha)$. 
Take $x$ in the connected component $X_\alpha$, then we have a map $I \to I \times X \xrightarrow{H} Y \to \pi_0(Y)$ sending $0\mapsto \pi_0(f)(\alpha)$ and $1\mapsto \pi_0(g)(\alpha)$. But $I$ is connected, so $\pi_0(f)(\alpha)=\pi_0(g)(\alpha)$.
\end{proof}

As a result, if $\pi_0(X) \not\simeq \pi_0(Y)$, the spaces $X$ and $Y$ cannot be homotopy equivalent, let alone homeomorphic.

\begin{ex}
Show the functor $[\pt,-]\colon \Top\to \Set$ descends to $\Ho\to\Set$.
\end{ex}

Here is a useful fact about spaces.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:pi0s_preserve_coprods}
For all families $X_\beta$, $\beta\in J$, of spaces, we have isomorphisms
\[
	\bigsqcup_{\beta\in J} \pi_0(X_\beta) \xrightarrow{\simeq}
	\pi_0(\bigsqcup_{\beta\in J} X_\beta)
	\quad\text{and}\quad
	\bigsqcup_{\beta\in J} [\pt,X_\beta] \xrightarrow{\simeq}
	[\pt,\bigsqcup_{\beta\in J} X_\beta],
\]
with inverses induced by the family of maps $\mathrm{in}_\beta$. 
That is, $\pi_0$ and $[\pt,-]$ \emph{preserve coproducts}.
\end{lemma}

\lecturenum{4}

Recall last time:\marginnote{$\xymatrix{\Top\ar[d] \ar[r]^{\pi_0}&\Set\\ \Ho\ar[ur]_{\pi_0}}$} 
we had functors $\pi_0\colon \Top\to \Set$ and $\pi_0\colon \Ho\to \Set$.

\begin{example}
If $X$ and $Y$ are spaces with $|\pi_0(X)|< |\pi_0(Y)|$, no continuous map $X\to Y$ is 
surjective.
\end{example}

Here is an instructive example

\begin{example}

The \emph{topologist's sine curve} is the image $C$ of $[-1,1]\sqcup (0,1]\to \RR^2$ defined by
\[\begin{cases}
	y \mapsto (0,y) & y\in [-1,1]\\
	x \mapsto (x,\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})) & x\in (0,1]
\end{cases}\]
equipped with the \textbf{subspace topology}. This is a compact metric space, using the 
inherited Euclidean metric. Fact: \emph{every} continuous function $f\colon C\to \{0,1\}$ is constant.
If $f(1,\sin(1))=1$, then $f(x,\sin(x))=1$ for every $x\in (0,1]$ (as intervals are connected).
If $f(0,0)=b \in \{0,1\}$, then $f(0,y) = b$ also, for all $y\in [-1,1]$.
The sequence $(\frac{1}{n\pi},0)$ converges to $(0,0)$ in $C$, so 
$b = f(0,0) = \lim_{n\to\infty} f(\frac{1}{n\pi},0) = 1$ as $f$ is continuous and we are in a metric space.

Hence $C$ is connected, but there is \emph{no}\marginnote{Exercise: prove this by considering 
$\lim_{n\to\infty}\gamma(\frac{1}{n})$} continuous function $\gamma\colon [0,1]\to C$ with 
$\gamma(0)=(0,0)$ and $\gamma(1) = (1,\sin(1))$. Since intervals are path connected, we can 
show $[\pt,C]=\{0,1\}$, but $\pi_0(C)=*$.
\end{example}

So we have two different invariants here, and there is always a surjective map 
$[\pt,X]\to \pi_0(X)$. Moreover, the following square of functions between sets always commutes, 
for any map $X\xrightarrow{f}Y$:
\[
\xymatrix{
	[\pt,X] \ar[r]^{[\pt,f]} \ar[d] & [\pt,Y]\ar[d]\\
	\pi_0(X) \ar[r]_{\pi_0(f)} & \pi_0(Y) 
}
\]
This is thus an example of a \emph{natural transformation}.

\begin{definition}
Given functors $F,G\colon \cC \to \cD$, a natural transformation $\alpha\colon F\Rightarrow G$
consists of the data:
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
	\item For every object $X$ of $\cC$, a specified morphism 
		$\alpha_X\colon F(X) \to G(X)$ (the \emph{components} of $\alpha$)
\end{enumerate}
such that for every morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ in $\cC$, the following square commutes:
\[
\xymatrix{
	F(X) \ar[r]^{F(f)} \ar[d]_{\alpha_X} & F(Y)\ar[d]^{\alpha_Y}\\
	G(X) \ar[r]_{G(f)} & F(Y) 
}
\]
A natural transformation is called a \emph{natural isomorphism} if all of its components are 
isomorphisms.
\end{definition}

For example, there are natural transformations 
$\mathrm{disc}\;U \Rightarrow \id\colon \Top \to \Top$, 
with component at $X$ the identity map $\mathrm{disc}(U(X)) \to X$, and 
$U\Rightarrow \pi_0\colon \Top \to \Top$, with component $U(X)\to \pi_0(X)$.

We seek conditions that will define a full subcategory of $\Top$ such that the components
$[\pt,X] \to \pi_0(X)$ of the natural transformation $[\pt,-]\Rightarrow \pi_0$ 
are isomorphisms for all spaces $X$ in the subcategory.

\begin{definition}
A space $X$ is \emph{semilocally path connected} (slpc) if it has a neighbourhood base of sets $N$ such that for any two $x,y\in N$, there is a path in $X$ from $x$ to $y$.
\end{definition}

Note that a space is slpc iff every connected component is slpc, and if $X$ is homeomorphic to $Y$, 
and one of them is slpc, then so is the other.

\begin{prop}
If $X$ is a semilocally path connected space, then $[\pt,X]\to \pi_0(X)$ is 
an isomorphism.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We are reduced to the case $X$ is connected ($\pi_0(X) = *$) and slpc, by Lemma~\ref{lemma:pi0s_preserve_coprods}, 
and the fact the case $X=\emptyset$ is trivial.
Since $X$ is connected, take $x\in X$ and define $\chi\colon X\to \{0,1\}$ by
\[
	\chi(y) = \begin{cases}
			1 & \exists y \rightsquigarrow x \\
			0 & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}
\]
where by $y\rightsquigarrow x$ I mean a path $\gamma\colon I\to X$ with $\gamma(0)=y$ and $\gamma(1)=x$.
We will show $\chi$ is continuous. Note that $\chi$ continuous $\Leftrightarrow$ $p^{-1}(0)$ and $p^{-1}(1)$ open $\Leftrightarrow$ $p^{-1}(1)$ open and closed. But $p^{-1}(1)=:C_x$ is the path component containing $x$.
Take $y\in C_x$ (so $\exists y\rightsquigarrow x$), and $V\ni y$ a path-connected nhd. Given $z\in V$, $\exists z\rightsquigarrow y$. Concatenate these paths to give
$z\rightsquigarrow x$, so that $z\in C_x$. This is true for all $z\in V$, so that $V\subseteq C_x$, hence $C_x$ contains a neighbourhood of each of its points, and so is open.

Conversely, take $y\in \overline{C_x}$, $V\ni y$ a path connected nhd. As $\exists z\in V\cap C_x \subseteq V$,
$\exists z\rightsquigarrow y$. But also have $V\cap C_x \subseteq C_x$, so $\exists z\rightsquigarrow x$. Concatenate paths to get $y\rightsquigarrow x$, so that $y\in C_x$.
This is true for all $y\in \overline{C_x}$, so $\overline{C_x} \subseteq C_x$ and $C_x$ is closed. Hence $\chi$ is continuous.

But $X$ is connected, and $\chi(x) = 1$, so that $\im\chi=\{1\}$, and so $C_x = \chi^{-1}(1) = X$. 
Thus $[\pt,X] \to \pi_0(X) = *$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

So we will consider for the rest of this section of the course only slpc spaces, which form a full 
subcategory $\slpcTop \hookrightarrow \Top$.
Note that discrete spaces are slpc, so $\Set \hookrightarrow \slpcTop$ is a subcategory.

\begin{example}
Any path-connected space $X$ is slpc, since for any nhd $N$ and points $x,y\in N$, we know there is a
path $I\to X$ between $x$ and $y$.
\end{example}

\begin{ex}
Show that the product of two slpc spaces is slpc, and that any locally convex topological vector space is slpc.
\end{ex}

\begin{example}
Any manifold is slpc, since every point lives in a chart homeomorphic to some $\RR^n$, and $\RR^n$ is path-connected.
\end{example}

Be warned: subspaces of slpc spaces may not be slpc, for instance the topologist's sine curve is a subspace of the contractible $\RR^2$.

\begin{q}
If $X$ is slpc and $q\colon X\to Y$ is a quotient map,\marginnote{so $Y$ has the final topology wrt $q$}
 then is $Y$ slpc?
\end{q}

%Here is a condition that can be used to transfer slpc-ness.

%\begin{definition}
%A \emph{local homeomorphism} $X\xrightarrow{p} Y$ is a map of spaces such that for all $x\in X$ there is basis of nhds $U$ of $x$ such that for each such $U$
%$\exists$ $V$ a nhd of $p(x)$ such that $p\big|_U\colon U \xrightarrow{\sim}V$.
%\end{definition}

%Examples include:\marginnote{A trivial example is the inclusion of an open subspace}
% maps $\sqcup U_\alpha \to X$ induced by open an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $X$, 
%the exponential map $\exp\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^\times$, the $n^\text{th}$-power map $U(1) \xrightarrow{(-)^n} U(1)$
%and the projection $S\times X\to X$ for $S$ discrete.

%\begin{lemma}
%If $X\xrightarrow{p}Y$ is a local homeomorphism, then $Y$ lpc implies  $X$ is lpc. If $p$ is surjective
%then $X$ lpc implies $Y$ lpc. [[TRUE FOR SLPC??]]
%\end{lemma}

One last technical point

\begin{definition}
A \emph{pointed space} is a pair $(X,x)$ where $X$ is a topological space and $x\in X$. 
A pointed map is a pointed map between the underlying pointed sets that is continuous.
These define a category $\Top_*$.
\end{definition}

A \emph{pointed homotopy} of pointed map $I\times X\to Y$, for $(X,x_0)$ and $(Y,y_0)$ pointed spaces, is required 
to satisfy $H(t,x_0) =y_0$ for all $t\in I$.
Pointed homotopy classes of pointed map are denoted $[(X,x_0),(Y,y_0)]_*$.
The category $\Ho_*$ is defined analogously to $\Ho$. 
We get a functor $\pi_0\colon \Ho_* \to\Set_*$. 

\section{Covering spaces}

Sometimes when we are thinking about a particular space $X$, we need to construct other spaces 
related to $X$ to study objects of interest.

\begin{example}
Take $X = \mathbb{X}^\times :=\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0\}$. Then the function $x\mapsto\sqrt{x}$ is
not well-defined, and if we take a branch cut to give an actual function, it is not continuous on $X$.
Even worse, if have a continuous function $f\colon \mathbb{C}^\times \to \mathbb{C}$, we may or may not have $x\mapsto f(\sqrt{x})$ continuous.
However, we \emph{do} get a continuous function if we change the domain somewhat. 
The problem is that the function $Z :=\mathbb{C}^\times \ni z\mapsto z^2 = x \in \mathbb{C}^\times$ is not injective, so not invertible.
But if we are willing to take the domain to be $Z$, and so pass into $f$ the argument $z$ (which satisfies $z^2 = x$)
then we are now just dealing with a continuous function.
If $f$ is such that $f(z) = f(-z)$ for all $z\in Z$, then we get a well-defined function on $X$.
\end{example}

The properties of the map $z\mapsto z^2$ (at least away from $0$) and others like $z^n$, $\exp(z)$, rational functions away from poles and critical points and so on, lead to the notion of 
covering spaces of certain domains in $\mathbb{C}$. We have a general definition for arbitrary spaces.


%Given a local homeomorphism $X\xrightarrow{p}Y$, the \emph{fibre} $p^{-1}(y)\subset X$ over $y$ has the discrete topology for every $y\in Y$.
%We have no idea how $p^{-1}(\gamma(t))$ varies along a path $\gamma \colon I\to Y$. 
%For example, given an arbitrary collection $B(x_\alpha,r_\alpha)\subset \RR^2$ of open balls,
%$\sqcup_\alpha B(x_\alpha,r_\alpha) \to \RR^2$ is a local homeomorphism, but the fibres can
%jump in size arbitrarily.
%We would like fibres `close' to a given $p^{-1}(y)$ to `vary continuously'. For spaces `vary continuously' really means homotopy equivalence.
%But for discrete spaces, homotopy equivalence is isomorphism.

\begin{definition}
A\marginnote{%
\[
\xymatrix{\pi^{-1}(V_x) \ar[r]^-\simeq \ar[d]_{\pi} & V_x \times \pi^{-1}(x)\ar[dl]^{\pr_1}\\V_x}
\]
}
 \emph{covering space} $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} X$ of $X$ is a space $Z$ equipped with a map $\pi$ such that for all $x\in X$ 
there is a nhd $V_x \ni x$ such that $\pi^{-1}(V_x) \simeq V_x \times \pi^{-1}(x)$ \emph{over} $V_x$. 
(We will also call $\pi$ itself a \emph{covering map}.)
\end{definition}

For a covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi}X$ and $x\in X$, let $Z_x :=\pi^{-1}(x)$.
We will also call $X$ the \emph{base space}.

Examples include: $\exp\colon \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}^\times$, $S^2 \to \RR\mathbb{P}^2$, 
$U(1) \xrightarrow{(-)^n} U(1)$, covers of the join $\infty$ of two circles.

\begin{ex}
Show that if $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} Y$ is a covering map, and $Y\xrightarrow{\rho} X$ is a 
covering map, then $Z\xrightarrow{\rho\pi} X$ is a covering map.
\end{ex}


\begin{prop}\label{prop:iso_fibres_of_cov_sp}
For a covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi}X$, if $\exists x_0 \rightsquigarrow x_1$, then $Z_{x_0} \simeq Z_{x_1}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
(First proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:iso_fibres_of_cov_sp}) Take $\gamma \colon I \to X$, $\gamma(i) = x_i$, and an open cover $\{U_\alpha\}$ of $X$
over which $Z$ trivialises. We thus get an open cover $\gamma^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ of $I$, which has a finite subcover $U_0,\ldots, U_N$, with $x_0 \in U_0$, $x_1 \in U_N$. 
The ordering is chosen\marginnote{we can shrink the cover slightly to make this ordering well-defined, if need be} so that the path enters $U_i$ before it enters $U_{i+1}$, and $U_i\cap U_{i+1}$ has at least one point of the path in it.

We have isomorphisms $Z_{U_n} := \pi^{-1}(U_n) \xrightarrow{\phi_n} U_n \times F_n$ with discrete spaces $F_n$.
We have $Z_{x_0} \simeq F_0$, and for all $t\in \gamma^{-1}(U_0)$, $Z_{\gamma(t)} \simeq F_0$.
So for $\gamma(t) \in U_0\cap U_1$, we have $F_0 \simeq Z_{\gamma(t)} \simeq F_1$. 
We can then prove by induction on $N$ that $F_0 \simeq F_1 \simeq \cdots \simeq F_N$.
\end{proof}

So for slpc $X$ and each $\alpha \in \pi_0(X)$, there is associated to $Z\xrightarrow{\pi}X$ 
an isomorphism class of sets, the \emph{typical fibre} over all $x$ in the connected component 
$X_\alpha\subseteq X$.

\textbf{Note:} Fibres can be empty! But we usually don't think about this case too much. For 
$X$ pointed (by $x\in X$), we can consider pointed covering spaces $(Z,x) \to (X,x)$.
This is from one perspective just a choice of point $z\in Z_x$. For $X$ connected and slpc, 
a pointed covering space has every fibre contain at least one point, namely the image of $z$ under
$Z_x \simeq Z_{x'}$.

We have categories $\Cov_X$ and $\Cov_{(X,x)}$ with objects covering spaces of $X$ 
(resp.\ pointed covering spaces of $(X,x)$) and maps
\[
\xymatrix{Z_1 \ar[rr] \ar[dr] && Z_2\ar[dl]\\& X}
\]
and analogously in the pointed case. We will study these categories and see what they 
tell us about the topology of $X$.

\begin{example}
For $X = \mathbb{C} \setminus \{p_1,\ldots,p_n\}$, the study of $\Cov_X$ tells us about possible
Riemann surfaces for holomorphic functions with critical values precisely $p_1,\ldots , p_n$.
\end{example}

For \lecturenum{5} slpc and connected $X$, the fact that for a covering space $Z$ of $X$, 
there mrely \emph{exists} some $Z_{x_0} \simeq Z_{x_1}$ 
for arbitrary $x_0,x_1\in X$ can be improved. We first need a construction on covering spaces.

\begin{definition}\label{def:pullback_of_cov_sp}
Given a covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} X$ and a map $Y\xrightarrow{f} X$, the \emph{pullback} 
of $Z$\marginnote{actually $\pi$ doesn't have to a covering map; this construction works for any pair of maps to a space} is the subspace 
\[
f^*Z := Y\times_X Z = \{ (y,z)\in Y\times Z \mid f(y) = \pi(z)\}\subseteq Y\times Z.
\]
 It fits in a commutative square
\[
\xymatrix{
f^*Z \ar[d]_{p} \ar[r] & Z \ar[d] \\
Y \ar[r] & X
}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
In the setting of Definition~\ref{def:pullback_of_cov_sp}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f^*Z\to Y$ is a covering space.
\item $f^*$ is a functor $\Cov_X \to \Cov_Y$.
\item Given $Y_2 \xrightarrow{g} Y_1 \xrightarrow{f} X$ and $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} X$, there is 
a canonical isomorphism $(f\circ g)^*Z \simeq g^*f^*Z$ in $\Cov_{Y_2}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{corollary}
The fibre $(f^*Z)_y$ is canonically isomorphic to $Z_{f(y)}$.
\end{corollary}

Now given a path $\gamma\colon I \to X$ and a covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi}X$, we can 
pull back $Z$ to get a covering space $\gamma^*Z \to I$.
So let us try to understand covering spaces of $I$. 
Certainly for discrete $S$, the projection $S\times I \to I$ is a covering space.


\begin{prop}\label{prop:covering_sp_of_interval_triv}
A covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} I$ is isomorphic to the trivial covering space $\pi^{-1}(0) \times I \xrightarrow{\pr_2} I$ 
in $\Cov_I$.
\end{prop}

We first need a little helper lemma

\begin{lemma}
A covering space of a compact space $X$ trivialises over a \emph{finite} cover of $X$ by nhds.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}(of Proposition~\ref{prop:covering_sp_of_interval_triv})
We use the lemma to trivialise $Z\to I$ over a finite cover of $I$, 
which we can take to be by intervals $[0,t_1]$, $[s_2,t_2]$, \ldots, $[s_N,1]$ 
for $s_1=0<s_2<t_1<s_3<t_2<\cdots<s_N <t_{N-1} <1=t_N$.
We will proceed by induction on $N$, but this quickly reduces to the case of $N=2$.
So take a cover of $I$ by $[0,t]$ and $[s,1]$, where $\tau\colon Z_0 \times [0,t] \xrightarrow{\simeq}Z_{[0,t]}$ 
and we are given $\sigma\colon F\times [s,1]\xrightarrow{\simeq} Z_{[s,1]}$.\marginnote{we know abstractly that $F\simeq Z_0$, but this 
proof will construct an isomorphism}

By restriction there is the composite map
\[
Z_0\times [s,t] \underset{\simeq}{\xrightarrow{\tau|_{[s,t]}}} Z_{[s,t]} 
\underset{\simeq}{\xrightarrow{\sigma^{-1}|_{[s,t]}}} F\times [s,t] \xrightarrow{\pr_1} F.
\]
If we fix $z\in Z_0$, we get a continuous map $\{z\}\times [s,t] \to F$, which is thus constant, say at $p_z\in F$.
The function $z\mapsto p_z = \sigma^{-1}(\tau(z,s))$ is then a bijection $\phi\colon Z_0 \xrightarrow{\simeq} F$.

We thus get maps $Z_0\times [0,t] \hookrightarrow Z \hookleftarrow F\times [s,1] \xleftarrow{\phi\times \id} Z_0\times [s,1]$, 
which by construction agree on $Z_0\times [s,t]$.
There is thus a continuous map $Z_0 \times [0,1] \to Z$. Moreover, you can check this map 
is a morphism of $\Cov_I$. There are likewise maps
\[
Z_{[0,t]}\xrightarrow{\simeq} Z_0\times [0,t] \hookrightarrow Z_0\times I \hookleftarrow Z_0\times [s,1] \xleftarrow{\phi^{-1}\times \id} F\times [s,1] \xleftarrow{\simeq} Z_{[s,1]}
\]
which agree on $Z_{[s,t]}$, hence a continuous map $Z\to Z_0\times I$. 
This map is in $\Cov_I$ and cen be checked by pointwise evaluation to be inverse to the first one.
Hence We have an isomorphism $Z\simeq Z_0\times I$ in $\Cov_I$.
\end{proof}

%The isomorphism the proof constructs is even unqiue if we assume the isomorphism $\tau$ is the identity on $Z_0$.

\begin{corollary}
Given a covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi}I$ and a point $z\in Z_0$, there is a unique path
$\eta_z\colon I \to Z$ with $\eta_z(0)=z$ such that $\pi\circ \eta_z = \id$ (i.e.\ $\eta_z$ is a section of $\pi$)..
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
We can construct \emph{a} path, given $\tau\colon Z_0 \times I \xrightarrow{\simeq} Z$, by $\eta(x) = \tau(z,x)$. Since $\pi\circ\tau = \pr_2$, this has the required property.
Connectedness of $I$ and discreteness of $Z_0$ implies that given any other path $\eta'\colon I \to Z$ with $\eta'(0) = z$ and $\pi\circ \eta'=\pi$, we must have $\tau^{-1}\circ \eta = \tau^{-1}\circ \eta'\colon I\to Z_0\times I$ which implies $\eta'=\eta$.
\end{proof}

And now we have a really important property of covering spaces

\begin{prop}\label{prop:unique_path_lifting}
Given any covering space $Z\xrightarrow{\pi}X$, path $\gamma\colon I\to X$ and point $z\in Z_{\gamma(0)}$, 
there is a unique lift $\widetilde{\gamma_z}\colon I\to Z$\marginnote{a \emph{lift} of a path $\gamma\colon I\to X$ is a path $\widetilde{\gamma}\colon I \to Z$ with $\pi\widetilde{\gamma}=\gamma$}  with $\widetilde{\gamma_z}(0)=z$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
We can pull back $Z$ to get $p\colon \gamma^*Z\to I$. We have unique $\eta_z\colon I\to \gamma^*Z$
so that $\eta_z(0) = (0,z)$. Define $\widetilde{\gamma_z} = \pr_2\circ \eta_z\colon I \to Z$.
This path satisfies $\pi\widetilde{\gamma_z} = \gamma p\eta_z = \gamma$.
Given any other lift $\lambda\colon I\to Z$, we get a second section of $p$ by $x\mapsto (x,\lambda(x))$, which by uniqueness of $\eta_z$ has to be equal to it, so that $\lambda = \widetilde{\gamma_z}$.
\end{proof}

We can then give a second, more explicit proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:iso_fibres_of_cov_sp}.

\begin{corollary}
A path $\gamma\colon I\to X$ defines a bijection $[\gamma]\colon Z_{\gamma(0)} \xrightarrow{\simeq} Z_{\gamma(1)}$, by $[\gamma](z) = \widetilde{\gamma_z}(1)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
We only have to start with that $[\gamma]$ is a function $Z_{\gamma(0)} \to Z_{\gamma(1)}$, but the function 
$[-\gamma]\colon Z_{\gamma(1)} \to Z_{\gamma(0)}$, where $-\gamma\colon I \to X$ is the path
$-\gamma(x) = \gamma(1-x)$, is inverse to $[\gamma]$.
This is because the path $-\widetilde{\gamma_z}$ is a lift of $-\gamma$, hence 
$[-\gamma]([\gamma](z)) = \widetilde{-\gamma_{[\gamma](z)}}(1) = -\widetilde{\gamma_z}(0) = z$.
A symmetric argument shows that $[\gamma]([-\gamma](z))=z$ for $z\in Z_{\gamma(1)}$.
\end{proof}

A first observation is that this bijection is invariant\marginnote{consider 
$\psi$ as a path in $I$ and see what happens in that case} under reparameterisations of $\gamma$:
given $\psi\colon I\xrightarrow{\simeq} I$ with $\psi(0)=0$ and $\psi(1)=1$, then clearly 
$[\gamma\circ \psi]=[\gamma]\colon Z_{\gamma(0)} \to Z_{\gamma(1)}$.

Even better, we get a function 
\[
\left(\{\text{paths }x_0 \rightsquigarrow x_1\text{ in }X\}/\text{param}\right) \times Z_{x_0} \to Z_{x_1}
\]
If we take $x_0 = x_1 = x$, then this is a map\marginnote{we can take quotient by reparams if desired}
\[
\{\text{loops }x \rightsquigarrow x\text{ in }X\} \times Z_x \to Z_x
\]
such that each loop $x\rightsquigarrow x$ gives a bijection $Z_x\to Z_x$. So we can think of this instead as 
\[
\{\text{loops }x \rightsquigarrow x\text{ in }X\} \to \Aut(Z_x).
\]
Alternatively, if we have a pointed covering space $(Z,z) \to (X,x)$, we have a canonical function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loops_to_fibre}
\{\text{loops }x \rightsquigarrow x\text{ in }X\} \to Z_x
\end{equation}

\begin{example}
For $Z = S\times X$, $[\gamma] = \id_S$ always, and the image of (\ref{eq:loops_to_fibre}) 
(given some $(s,x)\in Z$) is just a single point. For instance, if $X=I$, we have seen this will be the case for every covering space.
But for $X=S^1$, $Z=\RR \xrightarrow{\exp} S^1$, and taking 
$x=1\in S^1$, $z = 0\in \RR$, then $Z_1 = \exp^{-1}(0) = 2\pi i \mathbb{Z}$, then 
\[
	\{\gamma\colon I\to S^1\mid \gamma(0) = \gamma(1) = 1\} \to 2\pi i \mathbb{Z}
\]
is \emph{onto}. The path $\widetilde{\gamma}_n = 2\pi inx$ lifts the path $\gamma(x) = \exp(2\pi inx)$,
and $\widetilde{\gamma}_n(0) = 0$, $\widetilde{\gamma}_n(1) = 2\pi inx$. 
The difference is that $\RR$ is path connected, but $X\times S$ is not, for $|S| > 1$. 
\end{example}

In fact, for a covering space $(Z,z)\xrightarrow{\pi} (X,x)$ with $Z$ path connected 
and $z'\in Z_x$, there is $\widetilde{\gamma}\colon I\to Z$ with $\widetilde{\gamma}(0)=z$, 
$\widetilde{\gamma}(1)=z'$. Since $\widetilde{\gamma}$ lifts $\gamma = \pi\circ \widetilde{\gamma}$, 
which satsfies $\gamma(0) = x = \gamma(1)$, the map (\ref{eq:loops_to_fibre}) is \textbf{onto}.
Thus paths constrain the sizes of fibres of connected covering spaces and vice versa. 
Notice also that the set of loops is independent of the choice of covering space!

More generally, given points $z_\alpha$ in $Z_x$,\marginnote{that is: a section of $Z\to \pi_0(Z)$} one per path component of $Z$,
\[
\{\text{loops }x \rightsquigarrow x\text{ in }X\}\times \pi_0(Z) \simeq \{\text{loops }x \rightsquigarrow x\text{ in }X\}\times\{z_\alpha\} \to Z_x
\]
is always onto. There are a huge number of paths, and reparameterisations cuts things down somewhat. 
But we shall go even better, and put a topology on the space of paths.


The fibres\lecturenum{6} $Z_x$ of a covering space $Z$ are discrete spaces, but the set $\Top(I,X)$ of paths $I\to X$ carries a topology when $X$ is a metric space; we can consider $C(I,X)$ with the sup metric $d_\infty$.
The aim is to give $\Top(I,X)$ a topology for \emph{any} space, not necessarily metric.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:compact_open_base}
Let $X$ be a topological space, $\gamma\in \Top(I,X)$ a path, 
$0=t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_N < t_{N+1} = 1$ a partition of $[0,1]$, and $U_0, \ldots, U_N \subseteq X$ 
a collection of basic nhds such that $U_i \in \cN(\gamma(t))$ for all $t\in [t_i,t_{i+1}]$.
Define the subsets
\[
	N_\gamma(t_1<\cdots<t_N;U_0,\ldots,U_n) :=\{\eta\colon I\to X\mid\forall i=0,\ldots N,\ 
		\eta([t_i,t_{i+1}]) \subseteq U_i\} \subseteq \Top(I,X)
\]
Then these sets give a neighbourhood base on $\Top(I,X)$
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{path space} $X^I$ is the set $\Top(I,X)$ equipped with the topology defined by
Lemma~\ref{lemma:compact_open_base}, which we call the \emph{compact-open topology}.
\end{definition}

When $X$ is a metric space, then the compact-open topology and the topology arising from the 
sup metric coincide. A key property of the compact-open topology is that homotopies $H\colon 
I\times I \to X$ give continuous paths $h\colon I \to X^I$ (defined by $h_t\colon s\mapsto H(t,s)$) and vice-versa. Moreover:

\begin{lemma}
The evaluation map $\ev\colon X^I \times I\to X$, $\ev(\gamma,t) = \gamma(t)$ is continuous, and given a map $X\xrightarrow{f} Y$, the post-composition map $f_*\colon X^I \to Y^I$, $f_*(\gamma) = f\circ \gamma$, is continuous.
\end{lemma}

Then given $t\in I$, the composite map $\ev_t\colon X^I \simeq X^I\times\{t\} \into X^I \times I \xrightarrow{\ev} X$ is continuous.
Usually we care just about the cases $t=0,1$. 
We can then look at various subspaces of $X^I$, for a given $x\in X$:
\begin{align*}
P_xX & := \{\gamma \in X^I\mid \gamma(0)=x\} = \ev_0^{-1}(x)\\
P_x^yX & := \{\gamma \in X^I\mid \gamma(0)=x,\ \gamma(1)=y\} = \ev_0^{-1}(x)\cap \ev_1^{-1}(y)\\
\Omega_x X & := P_x^x X = \{\gamma \in X^I \mid \gamma(0) = x = \gamma(1)\}
\end{align*}
In particular, we have already seen the last two, albeit without their topologies. We also see that path 
components of these spaces have something to do with homotopy classes of paths, perhaps with
constraints on endpoints.

A key property of the natural transformation $\id \Rightarrow \disc\pi_0\colon \slpcTop\to\slpcTop$
is that it has a universal property: given a discrete space $S$, an slpc space $X$ and a continuous
map $X\xrightarrow{f} S$, there is a \emph{unique} function $\pi_0(X)\to U(S)$ such that
\[
\xymatrix{
X \ar[r] \ar[d] & S\\
\disc(\pi_0(X)) \ar[ur]
}
\]
commutes. Hence if we take our function 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_space_action_fibres}
P_x^yX \times Z_x \to Z_y
\end{equation}
from the previous lecture, 
arising from a covering space $Z\to X$, and if we can show it is continuous, we would get a 
factorisation
\[
P_x^y X\times Z_x\to \pi_0(P_x^y X\times Z_x) \simeq \pi_0(P_x^yX)\times Z_x \to Z_y
\]
where the unmarked isomorphism exist due to $Z_x$ being discrete.
If $Z$ is path connected, a fixing some $z\in Z_x$, we get a surjective map $\pi_0(P_x^y X)\to Z_y$,
which further constrains both the topology of the space of paths, and the possible fibres of 
$Z\to X$. However, there are two issues:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item We yet don't know our path lifting function is continuous
\item We don't know if $P_x^y X$ is slpc, hence if path components and components agree.
\end{enumerate}

To address (i), the unique path lifting property from last lecture will be promoted to a
\marginnote{here $X^I \times_X Z = \{(\gamma,z)\mid \gamma(0) = \pi(z)\}$} 
\emph{continuous function} $\Lift\colon X^I\times_X Z \to Z^I$. Combined with $Z^I \xrightarrow{\ev} Z$
we will be able to reconstruct (\ref{eq:path_space_action_fibres}) as
\[
P_x^y X \times Z_x \into X^I \times_X Z \xrightarrow{\Lift} Z^I \xrightarrow{\ev_1} Z
\]
factors through $Z_y \subset Z$. We already have the definition of $\Lift$, but we need to show 
continuity.

\begin{theorem}
The function $\Lift\colon X^I\times_X Z \to Z^I$ is continuous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We need to set up the ingredients, so take $\gamma \in X^I$, 
define $x=\gamma(0)$, $y=\gamma(1)$, and take $z\in Z_x$.
Let $\widetilde{\gamma} = \Lift(\gamma,z)$, and $z'=\widetilde{\gamma}(1)\in Z_y$.
Take a basic nhd $N_{\widetilde{\gamma}} = N_{\widetilde{\gamma}}(t_1 < \cdots<t_n;U_0,\ldots, U_n)$.
We want to construct a basic nhd
\[
M(\gamma,z) \subseteq X^I \times_X Z
%:= \left(N_\gamma(s_1<\cdots<s_m;V_0,\ldots, V_m)\times W \right) \cap X^I \times_X Z
\]
of $(\gamma,z)$ such that $M(\gamma,z) \subseteq \Lift^{-1}(N_{\widetilde{\gamma}})$.

Since $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} X$ is locally trivial and $I$ is compact, we can find a sequence $W_0,\ldots,W_m\subseteq Z$ (with $m\geq n$) of nhds such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\pi\big|_{W_i} \colon W_i \xrightarrow{\simeq} \pi(W_i)$ and each $\pi(W_i)$ is a nhd in $X$, and
	\item $\forall i=0,\ldots, m$ $\exists j=j(i)$ with $W_i \subseteq U_j$.
\end{itemize}

There is then a refinement $0<s_1<\cdots<s_m < 1$\marginnote{so that $[s_i,s_{i+1}]\subseteq [t_j,t_{j+1}]$} such that $W_i$ is a nhd of $\widetilde{\gamma}(t)$ for all $t\in[s_i,s_{i+1}]$.
The set $\widetilde{N}_{\widetilde{\gamma}} := N_{\widetilde{\gamma}}(s_1<\cdots<s_m;W_0,\ldots,W_m) \subseteq Z$ is then contained in $N_{\widetilde{\gamma}}$.

But, defining $V_i := \pi(W_i)$, the partition $0<\cdots s_1 <s_m<1$ and the sets $V_0,\ldots,V_m$ satisfy the conditions required to define the basic nhd $N_\gamma(s_1<\cdots<s_m;V_0,\ldots, V_m)\subseteq X^I$. Also note that $z=\widetilde{\gamma}(0) \in W_0$, so we can define a nhd
\[
M(\gamma,z):= \left(N_\gamma(s_1<\cdots<s_m;V_0,\ldots, V_m)\times W \right) \cap X^I \times_X Z
\]
of $(\gamma,z)$. By construction $\pi(\widetilde{N}_{\widetilde{\gamma}}) \subseteq N_\gamma(s_1<\cdots<s_m;V_0,\ldots, V_m)$, but in fact $\Lift(M(\gamma,z)) = \widetilde{N}_{\widetilde{\gamma}} \subseteq N_{\widetilde{\gamma}}$, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
In fact, by the uniqueness of lifts, the map $\Lift$ is a bijection, and even a homeomorphism, with inverse $(\pi_*,\ev_0)\colon Z^I \to X^I \times _X Z$.
\end{rem}

So we have a continuous map $P_x^y X\times Z_x \to Z_y$, and thus get a function $\pi_0(P_x^yX) \times Z_x \to Z_y$.
But we would like to know that for any two points $\gamma,\eta\in P_x^yX$ in the same connected component, there is a path between them.
Such a path, recall, is a homotopy $H\colon I \times I \to X$ satisfying $H(s,0)=x$ and $H(s,1)=y$ $\forall x\in I$. Such a homotopy between paths will be said to \emph{fix endpoints}.

% We will give a sufficient condition, but the proof it is indeed sufficient will be relegated to a handout.

\begin{definition}
A space $X$ is called \emph{semilocally simply-connected}\marginnote{this is the last technical 
condition on spaces we require in this section of the course}
 (or \emph{slsc}) if every point has a basis of nhds $N$ that are path connected, and given 
$x,y\in N$ and two paths $\gamma,\eta \in P_x^y N$, there is an endpoint-fixing homotopy 
$I\times I \to X$ from $\gamma$ to $\eta$.
\end{definition}

Notice that if a space $X$ is slsc, then it is slpc.

\begin{example}
Any manifold is slsc, since every point has a nhd homeomorphic to some $\RR^n$, 
which is convex.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The \emph{Hawaiian earring} is the subspace 
\[
	\bigcup_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \left\{(x,y)\in \RR^2 \left|

and is not slsc. Every nhd of the point $(0,0)$ contains loops that are not contractible, and
stay non-contractible in the full space.

the space $X$ is semilocally simply-connected,

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}(Non-examinable)
See Handout 1.
\end{proof}


A question that may have occurred to you is what happens with the isomorphism 
$[\gamma]\colon Z_x\to Z_y$ if we break the path $\gamma\colon I\to X$ into two 
subpaths, say $x\rightsquigarrow x' \rightsquigarrow y$, and then compose the 
corresponding isomorphisms $Z_x\xrightarrow{\simeq}Z_{x'}\xrightarrow{\simeq}Z_y$. Or, 
starting from paths $\gamma,\eta\colon I\to X$ such that $\gamma(1) = \eta(0)$ and 
defining the \emph{concatenation} $\gamma\#\eta\colon I\to X$ by
\[
	\gamma\#\eta(t) = \begin{cases}
		\gamma(2t) & t\in[0,\frac12]\\
		\eta(2t-1) & t \in[\frac12,1]
	\end{cases} 
\]
how do $Z_{\gamma(0)} \xrightarrow{[\gamma]} 
Z_{\gamma(1)}=Z_{\eta(0)}\xrightarrow{[\eta]}Z_{\eta(1)}$ and 
$Z_\gamma(0) \xrightarrow{[\gamma\#\eta]}Z_{\eta(1)}$ relate?

\begin{lemma}
For paths $\gamma,\eta\colon I\to X$ such that $\gamma(1) = \eta(0)$, 
$[\gamma\#\eta] = [\eta]\circ[\gamma]\colon Z_{\gamma(0)}\to Z_{\eta(1)}$.
\end{lemma}

In particular, for $\gamma,\eta\in \Omega_xX$, $\gamma\#\eta\in \Omega_xX$ and we have 
the map $\Omega_x X \to \Aut(Z_x)$, which is compatible with path concatenation. But 
$\#$ is not associative!

\begin{example}
Take $X=S^1$, and let $\gamma(t)=\exp(2\pi it)$.
\[
	(\gamma\#\gamma)\#\gamma = \begin{cases}
		\exp(8\pi it) & t\in[0,\frac12]\\
		\exp(4\pi it) & t \in[\frac12,1]
	\end{cases} \quad \text{but}\quad
	\gamma\#(\gamma\#\gamma) = \begin{cases}
		\exp(4\pi it) & t\in[0,\frac12]\\
		\exp(8\pi it) & t \in[\frac12,1]
	\end{cases}
\]
\end{example}

Let\lecturenum{7} us re-examine how paths concatenate. Given $\gamma,\eta\colon I \to X$ 
such that $\gamma(1) = \eta(0)$, then we get a continuous function 
$\langle\gamma,\eta\rangle\colon [0,2] \to X$. The concatenation $\gamma\#\eta$ is then 
the precomposition of $\langle\gamma, \eta\rangle$ with the map $I=[0,1] 
\xrightarrow{t\mapsto 2t} [0,2]$. If we had a third map, $\lambda\colon I\to X$ with 
$\lambda(0)=\eta(1)$, then there is naturally a continuous function $\langle\gamma, 
\eta,\lambda\rangle\colon [0,3]\to X$. But the concatenations $( \gamma \# \eta ) \# 
\lambda$ and $\gamma \# ( \eta \# \lambda)$ arise from precomposing with two different 
maps $I=[0,1]\to [0,3]$. These are\marginnote{%

with graphs as at right.

These two paths $I\to [0,3]$ are homotopic fixing endpoints by the homotopy $h_a(s,t) = 
s\phi(t) + (1-s) \phi(t)$. If we then precompose 
$\langle\gamma,\eta,\lambda\rangle\colon [0,3]\to X$ with $h_a\colon I\times I \to [0,3]$, 
we get a homotopy between $( \gamma \# \eta ) \# \lambda$ and $\gamma \# ( \eta 
\# \lambda)$. Path concatenation in $X$ is then \emph{homotopy associative}. But what 
about inverses or an identity element? We will play the same trick, by considering a 
`universal' case.

Given a path $\gamma\colon I \to X$, we have the reverse path $-\gamma$,

and the composite $\gamma \# (-\gamma)\colon I \to X$ can be factored as 
$I\xrightarrow{\alpha} I \xrightarrow{\gamma}$ for a certain path $I\xrightarrow{\alpha} 
I$. If we instead concatenate in the other direction, namely $(-\gamma)\# \gamma\colon 
I\to X$, then this factors as $I\xrightarrow{\beta} I\xrightarrow{\gamma}X$. Again 
$\beta$ is a certain path in $I$. The graphs of both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are shown at 
right, and both of them are homotopic, fixing endpoints, to the constant functions at 
$0$ and $1$ respectively, by taking an affine combination as in the definition of $h_a$ 
above. Then by composing the homotopies here with $\gamma$, we get homotopies between 
the path $\gamma\#(-\gamma)$ and the constant path at $\gamma(0)$, and also between 
$(-\gamma)\#\gamma$ and the constant path at $\gamma(1)$. So we have \emph{homotopy 
inverses}.

If we want to think about a homotopy identity element, then we should use the constant 
path $c_x\colon I\to X$ at a point $x\in X$, with $c_x(t)= x$, $\forall t\in I$. We can 
factor the composite $\gamma\# c_{\gamma(1)}$ as $I\xrightarrow{\mu} I 
\xrightarrow{\gamma} X$ for $\mu$ as shown at right, and factor $c_{\gamma(0)}\#\gamma$ 
as $I\xrightarrow{\nu} I \xrightarrow{\gamma} X$. As above, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are 
homotopic, fixing endpoints, to the identity map $I\to I$.

If we turn the five homotopies $I\times I \to X$ described above into paths $I\to X^I$, then if we start from elements of $\Omega_x X$, these homotopies correspond to paths in $\Omega_x X$.
Thus $\Omega_x X$, which has a concatenation binary operator $\#\colon \Omega_xX \times \Omega_xX\to \Omega_xX$, acts like a group, except the group axioms only hold up to the existence of paths\marginnote{More is true, though we won't prove it: there are homotopies assembled out of these paths for all possible cases, for instance $I \times \Omega_x X \times \Omega_x X \times \Omega_x X \to \Omega_x X$} 
\begin{align*}
( \gamma \# \eta ) \# \lambda & \rightsquigarrow \gamma \# ( \eta \# \lambda)\\
\gamma\# (-\gamma) &\rightsquigarrow c_{\gamma(0)}\\
(-\gamma)\# \gamma &\rightsquigarrow c_{\gamma(1)}\\
\gamma\# c_{\gamma(1)}&\rightsquigarrow \gamma \\
c_{\gamma(0)}\#\gamma &\rightsquigarrow \gamma
\end{align*}
in $\Omega_x X$. As a result we have proved most of

\begin{prop}
Let $(X,x)$ be a pointed space, with $X$ slsc. The set $\pi_0(\Omega_x X)$ carries the 
structure of a group, its product arising from concatenation of loops and identity element 
represented by the constant path at $x$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
To exhibit the multiplication, consider the functor $\pi_0$ applied to $\Omega_x X 
\times \Omega_x X \to \Omega_x X$, giving $\pi_0(\Omega_x X \times \Omega_x X) \to 
\pi_0(\Omega_x X)$. But since $\pi_0(M\times N) \xrightarrow{\simeq} 
\pi_0(M)\times\pi_0(N)$, for all slpc spaces $M$ and $N$, we get a composite 
$\pi_0(\Omega_x X) \times \pi_0(\Omega_x X) \simeq \pi_0(\Omega_x X \times \Omega_x X) 
\to \pi_0(\Omega_x X)$. This is associative and unital, and inverses exist, by the 
existence of the paths above.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
For $(X,x)$ a pointed space its \emph{fundamental group at $x$} is 
$\pi_1(X,x) := [\pt,\Omega_xX]$, which for $X$ a slsc space coincides with $\pi_0(\Omega_xX)$.
\end{definition}

From the previous reasoning, we have constructed from a covering space $Z\to X$ and 
chosen basepoint $x\in X$ a permutation representation $\pi_1(X,x) \to \Aut(Z_x)$. If 
$Z$ is path connected, and we choose $z\in Z_x$, we get a surjective map $\pi_1(X,x) \to 
Z_x$, given by $\gamma\mapsto [\gamma](z)$. This implies we have an upper bound on the 
cardinality of fibres of any path connected covering space, and conversely, given a 
connected covering space, the fibres give a lower bound on the number of distinct 
homotopy classes of loops in $X$.

\begin{example}
The projection map $S^2 \to \mathbb{RP}^2$ is a covering space and $S^2$ is connected, 
so there exist at least two non-homotopic loops in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ at any given 
basepoint. One of these is the constant loop, so there exists a loop in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ 
not homotopic to it.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
We have the covering space $\exp(i-)\colon \colon \RR\to S^1$ with fibre $2\pi 
i\mathbb{Z}$, which implies $\pi_1(S^1,1)$ is an infinite group.
\end{example}

\begin{prop}
The loop space construction is a functor $\Omega\colon \Top_*\to \Top_*$.
\end{prop}


\begin{corollary}
The fundamental group construction is a functor $\pi_1 = \pi_0 \circ \Omega\colon \Top_*\to \Grp$.
\end{corollary}


However, as we have seen, we don't just get an action of $\pi_1(X,x)$ on the fibre $Z_x$ 
of a covering space. We also get what looks like an action of paths between different 
points on fibres, but now points in one fibre are taken to points of another fibre. In 
fact, if $X$ is not equipped with a basepoint to start with, or there are several 
natural options and no one of those is canonical, then we can create an even richer 
invariant, namely a \emph{groupoid}.\marginnote{A groupoid is a category where all the 
morphisms have inverses}

\begin{definition}
Given a slpc space $X$ and a specified subset $A\subseteq X$, the \emph{fundamental groupoid 
based at $A$}
is the groupoid $\Pi_1(X,A)$ with set of objects $A$, and $\Pi_1(X,A)(x,y) = \pi_0(P_x^yX)$. 
The composition map is defined to be
\[
	\pi_0(P_x^yX) \times \pi_0(P_y^zX) \simeq \pi_0(P_x^y X\times P_y^zX) \to \pi_0(P_x^zX)
\]
and constant paths are the identity morphisms.
\end{definition}

NOTE: concatenation of paths is continuous. Need to have established this.

So that we have an idea of what kinds of groupoids arise, let us consider some examples. 
We will be considering only \emph{small} groupoids: those locally small groupoids 
$\Gamma$ where there is a set $\Gamma_0$ of objects. We can then take the disjoint union 
of all the hom-sets to get the set $\Gamma_1$ of morphisms, and specify the source and 
target functions $s,t\colon \Gamma_1\rightrightarrows \Gamma_0$. Groupoids and functors 
form a category $\Gpd$.

\begin{example}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every set $S$ gives a groupoid, by taking the set of objects to be $S$, and to only have identity
morphisms. This gives a fully faithful functor $\Set \to \Gpd$, and such groupoids are called \emph{discrete}.
\item Every set $C$ also gives another groupoid with set of objects $C$, but there is exactly 
one morphism from any object to any other object. The set of morphisms is $C\times C$, and every 
object $c\in C$ has the trivial group of automorphisms. Such groupids are called \emph{codiscrete}.
\item Let $G$ act on the set $Y$ on the right. Then there is a groupoid with object set $Y$, and set of 
morphisms $Y\times G$. The source and target are given by $s(y,g)=y$, $t(y,g)=yg$, and composition is $(y,g)(yg,h) = (y,gh)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $G=1$, then this recovers the first example.
\item If $Y=\pt$, then the information in the groupoid is essentially just that of the group $G$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

A slogan people sometimes use is that a groupoid is like a group with `many identities', 
but you can also usefully think of them as being a generalisation of a group action, 
where you have different groups acting on different parts of the set. Here is a useful 
lemma about the structure of groupoids.

\begin{lemma}
For any groupoid $\Gamma$, and given $x,y\in \Gamma_0$,
\begin{align*}
	\Ad_a\colon \Gamma(x,x) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} \Gamma(y,y)\\
			g & \mapsto aga^{-1}
\end{align*}
is an isomorphism for any $a\in \Gamma(y,x)$\marginnote{$(\Ad_a)^{-1} = \Ad_{a^{-1}}$} and 
the function
\begin{align*}
	\Gamma(x,x)\times \Gamma(x,y) & \to \Gamma(x,y)\\
		(g,a) & \mapsto ga
\end{align*}
is a free and transitive action.\marginnote{transitive: $(ba^{-1},a) \mapsto b$;\\ 
\noindent free: $ga=a$ implies $g = gaa^{-1} = aa^{-1} =\id_x$}
\end{lemma}

As with other invariants, the fundamental groupoid is a functor. Define the category 
$\Top^{(2)}$ to be the category with objects pairs $(X,A)$ where $X$ is a topological 
space and $A\subseteq X$ is a subspace, and a morphism $(X,A) \to (Y,B)$ is a continuous 
function $f\colon X\to Y$ such that $f(A) \subseteq B$. We have a subcategory inclusion 
$\Top_*\into \Top^{(2)}$.

\begin{prop}
The fundamental groupoid gives a functor $\Pi_1\colon \Top^{(2)}\to \Gpd$ whose composition 
with $\Top_* \to \Top^{(2)}$ is $\pi_1$.
Moreover, $\Pi(X\times Y,A\times B) \xrightarrow{\simeq} \Pi_1(X,A) \times \Pi_1(Y,B)$.
\end{prop}

We can include \emph{unbased} spaces $X$ into pairs, by taking $(X,X)$, giving another 
fully faithful functor, $\Top \to \Top^{(2)}$. In this case, if the space $X$ has 
\emph{no} preferred basepoints whatsoever, we can still define the fundamental groupoid 
of $X$ itself as $\Pi_1(X,X)$, which is a functor $\Top \to \Gpd$.


We\lecturenum{8} haven't yet seen how to calculate the fundamental group(oid) in 
examples, so we will turn to that now. We need a name for spaces $X$ that have 
$\Pi_1(X)$ trivial, in the sense of being codiscrete.

\begin{definition}
A space $X$ that satisfies $\Pi_1(X) = X\times X \rightrightarrows X$\marginnote{such spaces 
also have $\Pi_1(X,A) = A\times A \rightrightarrows A$ for all $A\subseteq X$} is called 
\emph{simply-connected}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Convex subspaces $C\subseteq \RR^n$ are simply-connected, because any two points $v,w\in C$ 
can be joined by a path in $C$, and given two paths $\gamma,\eta\colon v\rightsquigarrow w$
the map $(s,t)\mapsto s\gamma(t)+(1-s)\eta(t)$ is a homotopy between them.
\end{example}

In particular, the interval $I$ is simply-connected. The fundamental groupoid $\Pi_1(I,\{0,1\})$
is important enough to have its own name: $\mathbf{2}$, sometimes denoted 
$(0\xrightarrow{\sim} 1)$, as it has two objects $0,1$ and a unique isomorphism between them.

\begin{ex}
Define a \emph{star-shaped region}\marginnote{For $\mathcal{H} \subset \mathbb{C}$ the
(open) upper half-plane, the set $\mathcal{H}\cup\mathbb{Q}$ is star-shaped, but not convex} 
in a (real or complex) vector space $V$ to be a set 
$K\subseteq V$ such that there is a point $v_0\in K$ such that for every $v\in K$ and $t\in I$,
$tv_0+(1-t)v\in K$. Prove that star-shaped regions are simply-connected.
\end{ex}

Simply-connected spaces are special for the following reason.

\begin{prop}
If $X$ is a simply-connected space, then every path connected covering space 
$Z\xrightarrow{\pi} X$ is trivial, in the sense that $\pi$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $\pi_1(X,x) \to Z_x$ is surjective for any $x\in X$, so $X$ simply-connected implies
$Z_x = \pt$ for all $x$. Thus $\pi$ is a bijection. The local triviality condition implies 
that every $x\in X$ has an open set $U\ni x$ such that $\pi^{-1}(U) \to U$ is a homeomorphism. 
Letting $U_\alpha$ range over such an cover of $X$, we can glue the inverses of these local 
homeomorphisms into a into an inverse for $\pi$.
\end{proof}



\begin{example}
If $X$ is contractible then it is simply-connected. Let $H\colon I\times X \to X$ be a 
contraction to $x_0\in X$. Consider the induced map $h= \Pi_1(H)\colon \Pi_1(I\times X, 
\{0,1\}\times X) \to \Pi_1(X,X) = \Pi_1(X)$. The domain simplifies to be 
$\Pi_1(I,\{0,1\})\times \Pi_1(X) = \mathbf{2}\times \Pi_1(X)$. Consider the induced maps 
$\{i\}\times \Pi_1(X)\to \mathbf{2}\times \Pi_1(X) \to \Pi_1(X)$ for $i=0,1$. Since 
$H\big|_{\{0\}\times X}=\id_X$, so $h_{\{0\}\times \Pi_1(X)}=\id_{\Pi_1(X)}$; and as 
$H\big|_{\{1\}\times X}$ is constant at $x_0$, so $h(0,x) = x_0$ for all $x\in X$, and 
$h\big|_{\{1\}\times \Pi_1(X)}$ sends every path to the constant path at $x_0$. We 
already know that $X$ is path connected, so that for any $x,y\in X$ there is some path 
between them. Given a path $\gamma\colon x\rightsquigarrow y$ consider the square
\[
	\xymatrix{
	(0,x) \ar[r]^{(\id_0,\gamma)} \ar[d] & (0,y) \\
	(1,x) \ar[r]_{(\id_1,\gamma)} & (1,y) \ar[u]
	}
\]
in $\mathbf{2}\times \Pi_1(X)$. Under $h$ this is sent to
\[
	\xymatrix{
	x\ar[r]^\gamma \ar[d] & y \\
	x_0 \ar[r]_{\id} & x_0 \ar[u]
	}
\]
The vertical arrows are independent of $\gamma$, so that every path $\gamma$ in $X$ is 
homotopic to the composite the long way around the square, hence to every other path.
\end{example}


\begin{example}
Let $X = X_1 \sqcup X_2$ be a disjoint union.\marginnote{The disjoint union of groupoids is 
what you think it is: take the disjoint union of the objects and the morphisms} Then for 
$A = A_1 \sqcup A_2$ with $A_i\subseteq X_i$,
$\Pi_1(X,A) = \Pi_1(X_1,A_1)\sqcup \Pi_1(X_2,A_2)$.
\end{example}

So in some sense, we are interested in spaces that are path connected, though this is 
useful when building spaces out of disjoint components. Here is another way we can get 
information about the fundamental groupoid of a space from the fundamental groupoid of 
other spaces.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:cov_space_gives_faithful_functor}
Let $Z\xrightarrow{\pi} X$ be a covering space.\marginnote{thus the funtor $\Pi_1(\pi)$ is \emph{faithful}} 
Then $\Pi_1(Z)(z_1,z_2) \to \Pi_1(X)(\pi(z_1),\pi(z_2))$ is injective for all $z_1,z_2\in Z$.
\end{theorem}

We will prove this theorem in a little bit, but let us give an important result that follows.

\begin{corollary}
Given a covering space $(Z,z)\xrightarrow{\pi}(X,x)$, $\pi_1(Z,z)$ is a subgroup of 
$\pi_1(X,x)$.
\end{corollary}

This allows us, given a covering space whose fundamental groupoid we know, to place a 
lower bound on the size of the fundamental group of the base space. Alternatively, it 
places an upper bound on the size of the fundamental group of the covering space, so if 
$\pi_1(X,x)$ is finite, then so is $\pi_1(Z,z)$.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:cov_space_of_IxX}
Let $Z\to I\times X$ be a covering space. Then $Z\xrightarrow{\simeq} I\times Z_0$ over 
$I\times X$, where $Z_0 = Z_{\{0\}\times X}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
The function $Z\to I\times Z_0$ is given by $(\pr_1\circ \pi,\tau)$, for some 
$\tau\colon Z\to Z_0$, which we need to construct.
The idea is similar to the situation where we constructed the trivialisation of a 
covering space of $I$, which is the special case of $X=\pt$. 
Given $x\in X$, we get a trivisalisable covering space $Z_{I\times \{x\}}\to X$, and so 
a function $\tau_x\colon Z_{I\times \{x\}} \to I\times Z_{(0,x)} \xrightarrow{\pr_2}Z_{(0,x)}$. 
Hence we have a (potentially discontinuous) function $Z \to Z_0$ using the various $\tau_x$. 
We will write downa global version of this function using ingredients we already know to be 
continuous.

Given $(t,x)\in I\times X$, there is a path $(s,x) \rightsquigarrow (t,x)$ given by
$\eta_{(t,x)}(s) = (ts,x)$, which we want to vary continuously with $(t,x)$. We know that 
$I\times I \times X\to I\times X$, $(s,t,x) \mapsto (ts,x)$ is continuous, so that 
\begin{align*}
	I\times X & \to (I\times X)^I\\
	(t,x) \mapsto \eta_{(t,x)}
\end{align*}
is continuous. We can now define the composite
\begin{align*}
	\tau\colon Z & \xrightarrow{\simeq} (I\times X)\times_{I\times X} Z \to (I\times X)^I \times_{I\times X} Z 
	\xrightarrow{\Lift} Z^I\xrightarrow{\ev_1} Z\\
	z&\mapsto (\pi(z),z)\qquad \mapsto\quad (-\eta_{\pi(z)},z)
\end{align*}
This map factors through $Z_0$, as if $(t,z) :=\pi(z)$, then $-\eta_z$ is a path in $I\times X$ 
from $(t,x)$ to $(0,x)$ and so the evaluation of the lift of $-\eta_z$ at $1$ sits over $(0,x)$.
Since all the maps here are continuous, $\tau$ is continuous.

We need to supply a continuous inverse to $(\pr_1\circ \pi,\tau)$, which is built the 
same way, except now using $\eta_z$ itself to lift, rather than $-\eta_z$:
\[
	\sigma\colon I\times Z_0 \to (I\times X)^I\times_{I\times X} Z \xrightarrow{\Lift}
	Z^I \xrightarrow{\ev_1} Z.
\]
This is manifestly continuous, and one can check that this map is the required inverse by
considering the composite at each point separately, where it reduces to considering $Z$ 
restricted to $I\times \{x\}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{prop:pullback_by_homotopic_maps_iso}
If $f,g\colon X\to Y$ are homotopic, say by $H\colon I\times X \to Y$, and $Z\to Y$ is a 
covering space, then $f^*Z\simeq g^*Z$ over $X$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
If we form $H^*Z\to I\times X$, then we have by Proposition~\ref{prop:cov_space_of_IxX}
that $H^*Z \simeq I\times f^*Z$. But $g^*Z \to X$ is (isomorphic to) the restriction of 
$H^*Z$ to $\{1\}\times X$, hence is isomorphic to the restriction of $I\times f^*Z$, but this
is isomorphic to $f^*Z$.
\end{proof}

This gives us a criterion whereby we know that no interesting covering spaces exist

\begin{corollary}
If $X$ is contractible, then every covering space $Z\to X$ is isomorphic to $X\times Z_x$ 
for any $x\in X$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Let $H\colon I\times X \to X$ be a contraction to $x\in X$. Then for $c_x\colon X\to X$ the 
constant map at $x$, $c_x^*Z = X\times Z_x$. But $H$ is a homotopy between $\id_X$ and $c_x$,
and $\id^*Z = Z$, so by Corollary~\ref{prop:pullback_by_homotopic_maps_iso} we have the required
isomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Any locally convex topological vector space has no interesting covering spaces.
The unit sphere in a separable, infinite-dimensional Hilbert space has no interesting covering
spaces. The infinite-dimensional Stiefel manifolds likewise.
\end{example}


\begin{corollary}
Let\marginnote{%
$\xymatrix{
\{0\}\times X \ar[d] \ar[r]^-{\widetilde{f}} & Z \ar[d]^\pi\\
I\times X \ar@{-->}[ur]^{\widetilde{H}} \ar[r]_-{H} &Y
}$}
$Z\xrightarrow{\pi} Y$ be a covering space, $f,g\colon X\to Y$ a pair of maps and 
$H\colon I\times X\to Y$ a homotopy from $f$ to $g$. If $\widetilde{f}\colon \{0\}\times 
X\to Z$ is a lift of $f$, in the sense that the diagram at right commutes, then there is 
a unique homotopy $\widetilde{H}\colon I\times X \to Z$ lifting $H$ from $\widetilde{f}$ 
to a lift of $g$..
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
Since $I\times f^*Z \xrightarrow{\simeq} H^*Z$, and we have a section $X\to f^*Z$, then 
we get a section $I\times X \to I\times f^*Z$. Composing with the isomorphism we get a 
map $I\times X \to I\times f^*Z \to H^* Z \to Z$, and this both restricts to 
$\widetilde{f}$ on $\{0\}\times X$ and covers $H$. To show uniqueness, notice that 
$H(-,x)$ give a path in $Y$ for each fixed $x\in X$. Any lift $\widetilde{H}'$ of $H$ 
likewise gives paths $\widetilde{H}'(-,x)$. Since lifts of paths are unique, the 
$\widetilde{H}'(-,x)$ must agree with $\widetilde{H}(-,x)$ for all $x$, hence 
$\widetilde{H}'=\widetilde{H}$.
\end{proof}

We can now give the promised proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:cov_space_gives_faithful_functor}.

\begin{proof}
(of Theorem~\ref{thm:cov_space_gives_faithful_functor} Given paths $\gamma,\eta\colon z_1 \rightsquigarrow z_2$ in $Z$, and an endpoint-fixing homotopy 
$H\colon I\times I \to X$ between $\pi\circ \gamma$ and $\pi\circ\eta$, we can lift $H$ to give
a homotopy from $\gamma$ to a lift of $\pi\circ \eta$. Since $H$ fixes endpoints, the lifts of
the constant paths $H\big|_{I\times\{i\}}$, for $i=0,1$ are path in the fibre, discrete spaces.
Hence these paths are constant, and $\widetilde{H}$ is a homotopy fixing endpoints.
Since $\eta$ is a lift of $\pi\circ \eta$, unique path lifting gives that $\widetilde{H}$ is 
in fact a homotopy (fixing endpoints) from $\gamma$ to $\eta$. Thus $\gamma$ and $\eta$ give
the same element in $\Pi_1(Z)(z_1,z_2)$, and the induced map in injective as required. 
\end{proof}

Until now, a lot of our resuls only give bounds on or estimates between the fibres of a covering
space and the fundamental group of the base space. However, we can actually get an exact result, given a certain kind of covering space

\begin{theorem}
If $\pi\colon (Z,z) \to (X,x)$ is a covering space with $Z$ simply-connected, then the map 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:univ_cov_space_has_pi1_as_fibre}
\pi_1(X,x) \to Z_x
\end{equation}
is a bijection.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider two paths $\gamma,\eta$ representing classes in $\pi_1(X,x)$, such that 
$\gamma_*(z) = \eta_*(z) =: w \in Z_x$. Since the two lifts $\widetilde{\gamma}_z$ and 
$\widetilde{\eta}_z$ have the same endpoints, they both represent classes in $\Pi_1(Z)(z,w)$. 
But since $Z$ is simply-connected, $\Pi_1(Z)(z,w) = *$, so there is an endpoint-fixing homotopy between
$\widetilde{\gamma}$ and $\widetilde{\eta}$, say $H\colon I\times I \to Z$. But then 
$\pi\circ H$ is an endpoint-fixing  homotopy between $\gamma$ and $\eta$, so that they represent
the same class in $\pi_1(X,x)$, and so the map in injective. From [previous result] we knew it
was surjective, so $\pi_1(X,x)\to Z_x$ is a bijection as required. 
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
We now can say that $\pi_1(S^1,1)$ is not just infinite (see Example XX) but countable.
\end{example}

But\lecturenum{9} even better, we have not just a bijection, but a \emph{faithful permutation 
representation}.

\begin{corollary}
For $(Z,z)\to (X,x)$ a simply-connected covering space, $\pi_1(X,x)$ acts freely and 
transitively on $Z_x$.
\end{corollary}

And now we can give the first example of an actually calculated, non-trivial fundamental group.

\begin{theorem}
$\pi_1(S^1,1) \simeq \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We have the simply-connected covering space $\RR \to S^1 = \RR/\mathbb{Z}$, with fibre over 
$1\in S^1$ being the integers. The inclusion $[0,1]\to \RR$ is a lift of the loop $\gamma$ 
going once around the circle, and all lifts are translates of this, so that the action of 
$\gamma$ on the fibre $\mathbb{Z}$ is translation by $1$. The loop $\gamma$ generates a subgroup
whose action on $\mathbb{Z}$ is transitive, hence $\gamma$ generates all of $\pi_1(S^1,1)$,
which must then be infinite cyclic, hence $\mathbb{Z}$.
\end{proof}

How do we calculate $\pi_1$ in general? Or better, $\Pi_1$? First do disjoint unions. 
Let us consider the example given by $S^1\vee S^1$ which is a quotient of $S^1\sqcup 
S^1$. Need some covering spaces, including one\marginnote{The join of two copies of 
$S^1\vee S^1$ at a `non-crossing' point will do} that will allow us to show that 
$\pi_1(S^1\vee S^1,*)$ is non-abelian.
